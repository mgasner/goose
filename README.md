# The Goose Programming Language

A memory-safe systems language with no heap allocator, garbage collector, or
lifetime annotations. In this repository's benchmarks, Goose runs faster than
C++ and Rust while using less memory.

[Tutorial](docs/tutorial.md) · [Specification](docs/goose_spec.md) ·
[Samples](samples/README.md) · [Benchmarks](bench/summary.md) ·
[Standard library](docs/stdlib.md)

Goose has syntax familiar to C and Rust programmers, but **there is no heap**.
Every dynamic value lives inline on a data stack managed by the compiler.
Growth advances a pointer, and memory is freed when its scope ends. The
language's type and lifetime rules make this memory model safe to use.

## Why Goose

* **Faster than C++ and than safe Rust, while memory safe.** Over sixteen
  benchmarks Goose runs at 3.3x the speed of idiomatic C++, 1.16x hand-optimized
  C++ and 1.12x the best safe Rust, on 1.9x, 1.3x and 1.2x less memory
  ([summary](bench/summary.md), [full results](bench/results.md)). These gains
  come from Goose's data layouts and memory model.
* **No allocator, no GC, no reference counting, no destructors.** Memory is a
  handful of data stacks that the compiler assigns statically. Freeing a
  million-element structure is one store, however deeply it nests.
* **Growth preserves references.** A reference into a growing array stays valid for as
  long as the array does. You keep typed references where C++ must `reserve`
  and safe Rust uses `u32` indices in the corresponding benchmarks.
* **Memory safe with zero annotations.** No lifetime syntax, no aliasing or
  exclusivity rules, no `unsafe`. The compiler infers what every reference is
  rooted in and rejects references that could outlive their owners.
* **Nested data stays inline.** A string, an array of strings, a record with
  variable-size fields and an array of those records are each one contiguous
  block with no pointer in it. A record that is 160 bytes and an allocation in
  C++ is 29 bytes and none in Goose.
* **Enums that cost what they hold.** Variable-mode ADTs give each value its own
  variant's size rather than the largest one's: 4x less memory and 2x the speed
  of a Rust `enum` on the benchmark that exercises it.
* **Links narrower than pointers.** A relative reference stores a typed, checked
  link as a 1, 2 or 4-byte offset. Structures built from them are position
  independent, so your data structure is already its file format: saving is a
  write, loading is a read plus a verification pass that rejects hostile bytes.
* **Everything is built in place, guaranteed.** A value is constructed at its
  final destination through any depth of calls. `items.push(parse(line))`
  writes the parsed record straight into the array, and returning a growable
  array by value costs nothing.
* **Returns across multiple calls.** `return err from load` returns from a function
  any number of frames up, statically checked, with no unwinder, no `Result`
  type and no `?` on every call.
* **Threads that share nothing.** A worker is compiled as a separate program
  with its own memory, and flat values cross typed queues as a `memcpy`. Data
  races, locks, atomics and memory orderings do not exist in the language.
* **Generics and higher-order functions with no overhead.** An untyped
  parameter is generic. Function values are compile-time entities, so
  `xs.filter() { it > 0 }` compiles to the loop it looks like and builds its
  result straight into its destination.
* **Plain C in, plain C out.** Goose compiles to one C file, so it runs wherever
  a C compiler does and calls C directly through `extern fn`. The bundled
  TinyCC backend compiles and runs a program in-process, with no build step.

The [tutorial](docs/tutorial.md) walks through all of this by example, the
[specification](docs/goose_spec.md) has the exact rules, and the
[benchmarks](bench/summary.md) have the numbers, losses included.

## Features

This section focuses on what distinguishes Goose. The [tutorial](docs/tutorial.md)
explains these features in more detail, and the [samples](samples/README.md)
show them in twenty-nine complete programs.

### One memory model: stacks, and scope exit is the free

A program has the native call stack, static data and N data stacks, where the
compiler works out N. A data stack is a large address-space reservation with a
bump pointer, and there is no other memory. At most one resizable value is
live per stack and it is always on top, so growth never moves anything and
never checks a capacity. All of this is proved at compile time; the runtime
tracks only the bump pointers.

```goose
for round in 3 {
    var scratch: u8[>..] = [];                        // grow-only: growth is a pointer bump
    for i in 100000 { scratch.push((i % 256) as! u8); }
    print("round ", round, ": ", scratch.len, " bytes");
}                                                     // the free: one store to the stack top
```

### Nothing moves, so references survive growth

```goose
struct Item { id: i32, weight: f32 }

var items: Item[>..] = [];
let first .= items.push(Item { 1, 0.5 });             // a reference to element 0
for i: i32 in 2..1000001 { items.push(Item { i, 0.0 }); }
first.weight = 99.5;                                  // still valid, a million pushes later
```

`push` returns a reference to the new element, so a program can link elements
while building the array. A `vector<T>` or `Vec<T>` may reallocate and cannot
provide this guarantee. Stable references account for several benchmark gains.

### Safe references, no annotations

Every reference and slice has a static *root*: the variable that bounds its
target's lifetime. A reference must not outlive the variable that owns its
target or access that target through an incompatible type. The compiler infers
roots and specializes functions for them, so no annotations are needed. There
are no aliasing or exclusivity rules. When a lifetime check fails, the error
names the reference's root and its destination:

```goose
fn longest(a: u8[:], b: u8[:]) -> u8[:] { if a.len >= b.len { a } else { b } }

var outer: u8[>..] = [];
var w = outer[..];
{
    var inner: u8[>..] = [];
    format(inner, "inner text");
    w = longest(outer, inner);     // error: storing a reference rooted at inner,
}                                  //        which does not outlive the destination (§9.2)
```

A slice `T[:]` lets a function accept a range from any array kind without
copying its elements. For example, `split` returns slices into its input, and
a dictionary keyed by `u8[:]` stores views of strings rather than copies.

### Nested data stays inline

There is no single array type. There is a family that differs only in what
happens to the size, and every member is `[metadata][elements...]`, inline and
packed, never a pointer to an element block:

| Spelling | What it is |
|---|---|
| `T[k]` | fixed size, known at compile time |
| `T[]`, `T[varint]` | sized at construction, frozen after; a fixed or variable-width length |
| `T[..k]`, `T[..]` | capacity inline; grows and shrinks within it |
| `T[>..]` | **grow-only**: the workhorse; references into it stay valid |
| `T[>..<]` | **grow-shrink**: stacks, queues, heaps |

Strings are just `u8` arrays: `u8[>..]` is a builder, `u8[]` a finished string
stored inline in whatever holds it, `u8[..16]` a small string inside a struct,
`u8[:]` a view. A struct may contain variable-size parts, and they sit inline
in declaration order, so a record is a run of bytes with nothing indirect in it:

```goose
struct Item  { sku: u8[varint], qty: varint, cents: varint }
struct Order { id: varint, customer: u8[varint], items: Item[varint] }

var book: Order[>..] = [];
book.push(Order { id: 1001, customer: "alice",
                  items: [Item { sku: "SKU-441", qty: 2, cents: 1999 },
                          Item { sku: "SKU-7", qty: 1, cents: 500 }] });
```

That order is **29 bytes and 0 allocations**. As C++ `std::string` +
`std::vector<Item>` it is 160 bytes and 1 allocation, and as Rust `String` +
`Vec<Item>` 153 bytes and 4. A whole order book is one array that streams
through the cache. The price is that an array of variable-size elements is
sequential: you can iterate it but not index it (unless you keep a second
array of references into it as an index).

### Enums in two sizes

Algebraic data types are the only dynamic polymorphism: no inheritance, no
vtables. Every ADT can be stored two ways, chosen at the point of use. Fixed
mode (`Shape`) is a tag plus room for the largest payload, indexable and
overwritable. Variable mode (`Shape..`) gives each value exactly its variant's
size; the array becomes sequential and a value never changes variant, and in
exchange you may take references *into* a payload:

```goose
enum Shape { Circle { r: f64 }, Rect { w: f64, h: f64 }, Dot }

var packed: Shape..[>..] = [];                 // 9, 17 and 1 bytes, not 17 each
packed.push(Shape.Circle { r: 1.0 });
packed.push(Shape.Rect { w: 2.0, h: 3.0 });
packed.push(Shape.Dot);
for s in packed {
    match s { Rect &r => { r.w += 1.0; }, _ => {} }   // edits the payload in place, inside the array
}
```

*Case functions* provide another way to dispatch on a variant: define one
overload per variant. Calls dispatch on the tag through a jump table, and the
compiler checks that the overloads cover every variant:

```goose
fn area(s: Shape.Circle) -> f64 { 3.14159 * s.r * s.r }
fn area(s: Shape.Rect) -> f64   { s.w * s.h }
fn area(s: Shape.Dot) -> f64    { 0.0 }

for s in packed { print(s, " area ", area(s)); }
```

### Links narrower than pointers

A `T&` is a machine address: eight bytes, never dangling. A *relative reference*
is the same link stored as a narrow offset: `T&<u32>` is measured from the field
itself to a target in the same array, so the structure is position independent,
and `T&<u32 in pool>` from a named pool's base, so other arrays can link into
the pool. `T&<u32>?` uses offset 0 as null. Here is a binary search tree in one
grow-only array, with 12-byte nodes:

```goose
struct Node { key: i32, left: Node&<u32>?, right: Node&<u32>? }   // 12 bytes, links included

fn insert(pool: Node[>..]&, key: i32) {
    if pool.len == 0 { pool.push(Node { key: key }); return; }
    var cur .= pool[0];                             // .= binds a reference; = would copy the node
    loop {
        if key == cur.key { return; }
        let next = if key < cur.key { cur.left } else { cur.right };
        if next { cur .= next; continue; }          // narrowed by `if`: next is a Node&
        if key < cur.key { cur.left .= pool.push(Node { key: key }); }
        else             { cur.right .= pool.push(Node { key: key }); }
        return;
    }
}
```

References are transparent (no `*`, no `->`), `.=` binds or retargets one, and
`Node?` is a nullable reference that `if`, `guard` and `assert` narrow. The
insert is one push and one store, and the push cannot invalidate `cur`. When
lifetimes are not nested, a `reusable` pool pairs a grow-only array with a
hidden freelist: `alloc_ref` reuses a slot or pushes, `free` hands one back,
and since nothing is ever actually freed, a stale slot reads a *different value
of the correct type* rather than corrupting memory.

### Your data is already a file format

```goose
var image: u8[>..] = tree.to_bytes();           // a framed byte image of the whole array
var loaded, ok = from_bytes<Node[>..]>(image);  // verified before it becomes a value
image[image.len - 3] = 200;                     // tamper with a link ...
var bad, bok = from_bytes<Node[>..]>(image);    // ... and it is false and an empty array
```

The tree's links are self-relative, so it means the same thing wherever it
sits: saving is writing its bytes and loading is reading them back, with no
serializer, no schema and no pointer fixups. `from_bytes` checks the framing,
every tag, every length and every link before the bytes become a value, so a
corrupt or hostile file is a `false`, never a wild reference.

### Built in place, always

The copy-free construction guarantee ([spec §4.3](docs/goose_spec.md)) says a
constructed value is always built in its final home, propagated top-down
through calls. A function returning a grow-only array by value writes its
elements straight into the caller's variable, or into a field of the record
being built inside another array, so out-parameters mostly do not appear.

```goose
words.push(str("word", i));                    // formatted straight into the new element
let evens = xs.filter() { it % 2 == 0 };       // built straight into `evens`: no temporary
book.push(Order { id: 1001, customer: "alice", items: parse_items("SKU-441:2:1999;SKU-7:1:500") });
```

### Returning errors across calls

```goose
struct User { name: u8[..16], age: i32 }

fn load(text: u8[:]) -> User[>..], u8[] {
    var users: User[>..] = [];
    each_split(text, '\n') { users.push(parse_user(it)); };
    return users, "";
}

fn parse_user(line: u8[:]) -> User {              // returns a User: no Result, no error parameter
    let comma = find(line, ",");
    guard comma >= 0 else { return [], str("expected name,age: ", line) from load; }
    let age, ok = parse_int(line[comma + 1..]);
    guard ok else { return [], str("bad age: ", line) from load; }
    let name = trim(line[..comma]);
    return User { name: name, age: age as i32 };
}
```

`return E from f` returns `E` as the result of the innermost active call of
`f`, however many frames up, and every function in between keeps its plain
signature. It is checked statically, so every call of `parse_user` must lie
inside a `load` call and nothing is uncaught at runtime. It is a hidden
discriminant checked per frame rather than an unwinder, and the message is
built directly where `load`'s caller wants it. The parsers in the samples use
it for every syntax error.

### Generics and function blocks

```goose
fn twice(x) { x + x }                              // an untyped parameter is a generic one

fn each_pair<T, F>(xs: T[:]) {                     // F is a function value: a compile-time entity
    for i in 0..xs.len - 1 { F(xs[i], xs[i + 1]); }
}

fn first_gap(xs: i64[:]) -> i64 {
    each_pair(xs) { a, b => if b - a > 1 { return a; } };   // returns from first_gap, not each_pair
    return -1;
}

let evens = xs.filter() { it % 2 == 0 };
let total = fold(xs, 0) { acc, x => acc + x };
sort(xs) { a, b => a > b };
```

Everything is monomorphized. Type arguments are inferred from argument types;
parameters absent from those types can be supplied explicitly. Function values
are passed as generic parameters: every call is direct and inlinable, they
cannot escape, and there are no closure objects or function pointers, so a
higher-order function compiles to exactly the loop it looks like. A block may
`return` from its lexically enclosing function, and nested functions see the
enclosing function's locals.

### Threads that share nothing

```goose
thread_fn worker() {                                // a separate program with its own memory
    loop {
        let job = qget<Job>();                      // blocks on the typed queue for Job
        guard job.n >= 0 else { break; }            // -1 means stop
        qput(Result { n: job.n, digits: count_digits(job.n) });
    }
}

for i in n { ids.push(thread_spawn(worker)); }
```

There is no shared mutable memory. A `thread_fn` and everything it calls is
compiled as its own program with its own data stacks and its own copies of the
globals. Values cross through typed queues, one per type, and must be *flat*,
with no references at any depth. That is cheap because a flat Goose value is
contiguous: a job or a result carries real data, pixels included, and crossing
is a `memcpy`.

### Plain C in, plain C out

```goose
extern fn hypot(x: f64, y: f64) -> f64;             // straight from libm
extern fn crc32_bytes(s: const u8[:]) -> u32;       // a slice crosses as { data, len }
extern fn stats_of(xs: i32[:], out: Stats&);        // a struct filled through a pointer
```

An `extern fn` binds a Goose signature to a C symbol. The `math` and `os`
modules use this interface. Only types with supported C representations may
cross the boundary; unsupported signatures are rejected at the declaration.
The compiler emits one C file for the whole program. The bundled TinyCC
backend can compile and run that C inside the Goose compiler's process.

### Where the speed comes from

Much of the speed comes from the memory model: no heap allocation or
per-object teardown, contiguous data, narrow links, and enums sized for the
variant they contain. Every index is bounds-checked, and the compiler removes
checks it can prove unnecessary. An `assert` on a slice length often lets a
kernel eliminate its remaining checks and vectorize. `--bce-lines` reports
the checks that remain. Benchmark measurements use whole-process wall-clock
time, including teardown.

| Geometric mean over 16 benchmarks | vs idiomatic C++ | vs hand-optimized C++ | vs best safe Rust |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| speed, MSVC backend | 3.30x | 1.16x | 1.04x |
| speed, clang backend | 3.35x | 1.19x | 1.12x |
| peak memory | 1.93x less | 1.30x less | 1.24x less |

The [summary](bench/summary.md) explains the gains and losses;
[results.md](bench/results.md) has every measurement, and
[design.md](bench/design.md) explains what the suite tests.

### What it costs you

* You think about where data lives: who owns this, and how long does its scope
  last. Usually the answer is "the function that builds it", and that is free;
  when it is not, it is a `reusable` pool.
* Recursive functions cannot keep growable data across a recursive call;
  scratch ends before the call, and what outlives it is passed in as a pool.
* Arrays of variable-size elements iterate but do not index (short of an index
  of references kept beside them), a fixed-mode enum cannot be pointed into,
  and a variable-mode one cannot be overwritten. You choose per container.
* No escaping closures, no function pointers, no dynamic dispatch beyond ADT
  tags, and whole-program compilation only.
* A slot handed back to a `reusable` pool and still named reads whatever its
  next owner put there: a logic bug, never memory corruption.

[Tutorial §18](docs/tutorial.md#18-what-it-costs-you) is the full list.

## Build and run

You need CMake 3.20 or later, a C++20 compiler (MSVC, clang or gcc) and Python
3 for the test and sample runners. Four submodules are optional: TinyCC,
which the in-process backend is built from, SDL3, which the `gfx` graphics
module is built from, Box3D, which the `physics` module is built from, and
Nuklear, which the `ui` module is built from. The compiler builds without
these submodules, but the corresponding features are unavailable: JIT
execution, graphics, physics, or windows of widgets. SQLite, which the
`sqlite` module is built from, is vendored in `third_party/sqlite` and needs
no submodule.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/aardappel/goose
cd goose
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --config Release
```

To leave SDL, Box3D or Nuklear out, clone without `--recursive` and then run
`git submodule update --init` on the ones wanted, or configure with
`-DGOOSE_GFX=OFF`, `-DGOOSE_PHYSICS=OFF` or `-DGOOSE_UI=OFF`. On
Linux, SDL needs the X11 or Wayland development packages
([`third_party/SDL/docs/README-linux.md`](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/docs/README-linux.md));
without them the build leaves the `gfx` module out and says what to install.

The compiler is `build/goose` (`build/Release/goose.exe` with the Visual Studio
generator), and it finds the standard library in the source tree it was built
from. Run a program straight from source, in-process:

```bash
build/goose samples/01_tour.goose
```

Or generate C and build it with whatever compiler is around. Programs that use
threads need this route, since TinyCC cannot place thread-local storage. The C
that `-o` writes holds the program and the part of the runtime that inlines
into it; the rest of the runtime (the OS layer, data stack reservation,
threads, printing) is one more C file, which `--emit-runtime` writes, to be
compiled once and linked with every program:

```bash
build/goose --emit-runtime goose_runtime.c && cc -O2 -c goose_runtime.c
build/goose -o tour.c samples/01_tour.goose && cc -O2 tour.c goose_runtime.o -o tour -lm -pthread && ./tour
```

On Windows that is `cl /O2 /c goose_runtime.c` once and `cl /O2 tour.c
goose_runtime.obj`. Build the runtime with the compiler and flags the programs
use; it takes no `-D` of its own, and a program from another version of the
compiler fails to link against it. `--standalone` writes a C file that holds
the whole runtime instead, and builds on its own (`cc tour.c -o tour -lm
-pthread`). Useful flags: `--check` typechecks without emitting C,
`-O0`/`-O1`/`-O2` set the inlining level, `--bce-lines` reports the bounds
checks kept per line, and `-DGS_DEBUG=1` turns on the overflow, range and tag
checks in the generated C, each abort naming its source line (and an overflow
or a cast the values involved).

A program using `audio` plays procedural mono/stereo PCM through SDL3 without
opening a graphics window. The optional `GOOSE_AUDIO` build setting is independent
of `GOOSE_GFX`; generated-C programs link the response file named by
`goose --audio-link msvc|cc`. See the [audio reference](docs/stdlib.md#audio).

A program using `gfx` also links the graphics layer and SDL, which the compiler
names in a response file:

```bash
build/goose samples/27_gfx_cube.goose
build/goose -o cube.c samples/27_gfx_cube.goose && cc cube.c goose_runtime.o -o cube @$(build/goose --gfx-link cc)
```

With MSVC that is `cl cube.c goose_runtime.obj @<the path goose --gfx-link msvc
prints>`. A
program using `physics` links what `goose --physics-link` names the same way,
next to the gfx one if it draws too:

```bash
build/goose samples/28_physics_boxes.goose
build/goose -o boxes.c samples/28_physics_boxes.goose && cc boxes.c goose_runtime.o -o boxes @$(build/goose --gfx-link cc) @$(build/goose --physics-link cc)
```

A program using `sqlite` links what `goose --sqlite-link` names:

```bash
build/goose -o inventory.c samples/33_sqlite_inventory.goose && cc inventory.c goose_runtime.o -o inventory @$(build/goose --sqlite-link cc)
```

A program using `ui` links what `goose --ui-link` names, with the gfx one,
since its windows are drawn through gfx:

```bash
build/goose samples/29_ui_todo.goose
build/goose -o todo.c samples/29_ui_todo.goose && cc todo.c goose_runtime.o -o todo @$(build/goose --ui-link cc) @$(build/goose --gfx-link cc)
```

The test suite and the samples run on Windows, macOS and Linux:

```bash
python test/run_tests.py
python samples/run_samples.py
```

For editing, the [VS Code extension](vscode/README.md) gives syntax
highlighting, compiler checks on save and one-key runs through the JIT:

```bash
code --install-extension vscode/goose-language.vsix
```

## Status

Goose is new. What exists today is a whole-program compiler of about thirty
thousand lines of C++, the specification, the standard library, the samples,
and a test suite that CI runs on Windows, macOS and Linux with an extra
sanitizer job. Deliberately out of scope for now: moves for resizable values,
more than one resizable per struct, labeled `break`, namespace privacy, and
more OS/library access. Open items are tracked in the
[specification's Appendix B](docs/goose_spec.md#appendix-b-todo--open-items).

## History & Use of AI

This repo was produced almost entirely with AI, from a human language design.
I had designed Goose several years ago, and had started to implement it,
but running a game startup (which is built on another programming language of mine,
[Lobster](https://strlen.com/lobster/)) there was no time to finish it.
Which was sad, because I knew Goose could do things other languages can't,
and it should exist.

I had not expected AI to help with this until Fable came out. I thought it
might be capable enough to do a good job.
I made it essentially clone the style and structure of my other recent compiler
(Lobster), which is why if you look at the code, it looks rather similar to that.
My initial design had left lots of things unspecified, and lots of back and forth
with Fable made me decide on all of those, and it is now a better language for it.

It is also an experiment in using AI to implement a new language, rather than
reproduce an existing one.

You may wonder why I had it work in C++, if clearly I could have used any
language, like Rust, or my own Lobster, or.. Goose itself (that may still happen).
With Fable, it was my observation that it is almost equally capable in any
language, and the strong guardrails of Rust or other languages are not as pressing
as they once were.
Since the compiler emits C, you likely already need to have a C/C++ compiler around,
so sticking inside one ecosystem would seem to simplify deployment and adoption.
I've also integrated libtcc and who knows what other C libraries in the future.
And, like I said, to have the compiler code mimic my existing Lobster compiler seemed
fun, at least I can read it like it is my own.
