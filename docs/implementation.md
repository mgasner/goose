# The Goose compiler: implementation notes

These notes explain how the compiler in `src/` implements `goose_spec.md`.
They cover each pass, with particular attention to reference roots and
provenance, writability, shrinking, recursion, optimization, bounds-check
elimination, and C representations. There are two intended audiences:

* **Compiler developers and independent implementors.** Sections 1 to 8
  describe the data structures, rule enforcement, and conservative assumptions
  in each pass, with function names to help locate the implementation.
* **Advanced users.** Section 9 explains which bounds checks and copies the
  compiler can remove, and which representations generate efficient code.
  It refers to earlier sections for implementation details.

Conventions: `§n` refers to a section of the specification, `C.n` and `E` to
its appendices. File names are under `src/`; function names are given as
they appear there. These notes describe the current source, including the
supported subset in section 10. Section 11 records correctness defects;
their behavior is not a compatibility requirement.

**What an equivalent implementation must preserve.** Read these notes with
`goose_spec.md`: the specification defines the language, and these notes
make its implementation choices and current limits explicit. Equivalence
means the same type and lifetime decisions within that supported subset,
the same evaluation, mutation, results and required runtime failures, and
the specified layouts where bytes or C interfaces expose them. It does not
require the same AST, specialization count, stack numbering, optimization
thresholds, generated C text, or diagnostic wording. Bounds checks may be
removed whenever sound; acceptance must not depend on an optimization
proving an otherwise illegal lifetime safe. Debug arithmetic has the
specific optimization latitude given in spec §6.2.

The source names below are navigation aids, not prescribed algorithms. In
particular, an exact root is a claim about storage identity, while an
inexact root is only an outlives bound. Neither equal depth nor distinct
specialization parameters alone proves that two arrays cannot alias.

## 1. Pipeline

`main.cpp` runs the phases in this order; each is one or more headers in a
single translation unit, included in the order the driver lists them.

| Phase | Where | Consumes | Produces |
|---|---|---|---|
| Parse | `lexer.h`, `parser.h`, `ParseProgram` in `main.cpp` | source files, following `import` | the `Ast`: nodes, type expressions, symbols per namespace, globals in initialization order |
| Resolve | `resolve.h` (`ResolveTypeNames`) | type names as written | struct/enum/generic kinds, aliases substituted away |
| Typecheck | `typecheck*.h` (`TypeCheckProgram`) | the `Ast` | one `FnSpec` per specialization with a cloned, annotated body; `StructInst`/`EnumInst`; `VarDef`s; the store record; every diagnostic of §3--§11; the shader blobs `embed_shader` compiles (`gfx.h`, `shaderc.c`) |
| Optimize | `optimize.h`, `optimize_basecase.h`, `optimize_tre.h` (`Optimizer`) | live specializations | bodies rewritten in place (inlined, folded, loops), liveness and use counts |
| BCE | `bce.h` (`BCE::RunAll`) | live specializations | `Index::nobc`, `SliceExpr::nobc`, `ForLoop::fixedlen`, per-loop `hoistrefs` |
| Codegen | `codegen*.h` (`CodeGen`) | live specializations, globals | one C file, with `src/runtime/` (or its part a program's unit holds) around it |
| JIT | `jit.h` | the C text | the program run in-process through libtcc, when no `-o` was given |

The passes are virtual methods on `Node` (`ast.h`): `Dump`, `Clone1`,
`Children`, `Check`, `Cp1`/`Opt`, `BceWalk`/`BceMark`, `CgX`/`CgAny`/`CgStmt`.
The per-node bodies of each pass live together in one file (`dump.h`,
`clone.h`, `typecheck_nodes.h`, the tail of `optimize.h`, the tail of
`bce.h`, `codegen_nodes.h`) so that each pass can be read in one place. Shared
state and helpers belong to the pass object (`TypeCheck`, `Optimizer`, `BCE`, `CodeGen`),
split across the `typecheck_*.h` and `codegen_*.h` files by topic.

**Ownership.** `Ast` owns every node, type expression, type detail, symbol,
`VarDef`, instantiation and specialization in append-only tables; the trees
merely point at each other and nothing has a destructor. Type expressions are
shared templates: a function body is *cloned* per specialization
(`Node::Clone`) and the clone carries that instantiation's annotations
(`exprtype`, resolved symbols, `VarDef`s), and each of its nodes names the
node it copies as the source has it (`Node::origin`). The optimizer's
inliner copies with `Cp1`, which preserves annotations and remaps the
callee's `VarDef`s to fresh ones.

**The compile thread.** `Main` runs the phases up to the finished C on a
thread of its own with a 64 MB stack (`RunOnCompilerStack`, `COMPILERSTACK`
in `main.cpp`): the typechecker recurses as deep as the program's
compile-time call path (§3.1 below), and the platforms' main threads get
anything from 1 MB (Windows) to 8 MB (Linux and macOS by default). The stack
is reserved address space, committed only as deep as a compile goes. A JIT
run starts the program back on the main thread, which is where macOS lets a
window be made. The link reserves 64 MB for that thread's stack as well on
Windows and macOS (`CMakeLists.txt`); on Linux it has the stack limit the
process started with (`ulimit -s`), which nothing in the executable sets.

**Driver flags** (`Main` in `main.cpp`):

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--tokens`, `--dump`, `--parse` | stop after lexing, after parsing (dump is parse-level: no resolution), after resolution |
| `--roundtrip` | after resolution, parse the dump as a program of its own and require it to dump to the same text (`CheckRoundtrip`), then go on to whatever else was asked for |
| `--dump-file f.goose` | also write the dump to a file, and go on |
| `--check` | stop after typecheck, optimization and BCE; no C is written |
| `-O0`, `-O1` (default), `-O2` | inlining thresholds (§4); folding and propagation run at every level; base-case inlining and tail-recursion elimination need `-O1` or above |
| `--specs` | print every live specialization's optimized body |
| `--no-bce` | skip bounds-check elimination (this also loses the loop-view hoist, §6.10) |
| `--bce-test` | verify `// bce:elide` / `// bce:keep` annotations in the sources |
| `--bce-lines` | print elided/kept counts per source line |
| `--unsafe-no-rf-check` | omit the `return from` discriminant checks after calls: a measurement aid, unsound |
| `-o out.c`, `--jit`, `--header`, `-D`, `--include`, `--stdlib`, `--` | output file, in-process run, a C API header for the exports (which builds the C without a `main`, for a C host), a define written into the generated C, a user header, the stdlib directory, program arguments |
| `--gfx-link msvc\|cc` | print the response file of link inputs a program using `gfx` needs (`gfx.h`, `GfxLinkFile`) |
| `--physics-link msvc\|cc` | the same for `physics` (`physics.h`, `PhysicsLinkFile`) |
| `--ui-link msvc\|cc` | the same for `ui` (`ui.h`, `UiLinkFile`) |
| `--sqlite-link msvc\|cc` | the same for `sqlite` (`sqlite.h`, `SqliteLinkFile`) |
| `--multi-test a.goose b.goose ...` | compile each file in turn with the other flags, as a process of its own on it would (an `Ast` and a compile thread each, which is all the state a compile has), each file's output on both streams ending in a line `==== goose --multi-test: exit <code> <file>`; an `-o` names each file's C with `%` for its name. It runs no programs and writes no dump files. The test runner's batches of compiler runs (`docs/testing.md`) |
| `--compile-shader f [--shader-source msl\|hlsl]` | hidden: what a shader compiles to, without a program around it |

The debug build of the *generated* C is `-DGS_DEBUG=1` on the C compiler (or
`-DGS_DEBUG=1` to `goose`, which writes it into the file): it enables the
overflow, `as` range and ADT tag checks of §9.3. The Goose compiler's own
build configuration is unrelated.

---

## 2. Front end

**Lexer** (`lexer.h`): a hand-written scanner over a 0-terminated buffer; the
token set is an X-macro table. Lexing and parsing handle the syntax described in
§2 and Appendix D: `T&<u8>` is `&` `<` in type context, and `1..2` lexes as a
range because a `.` starts a fraction only when a digit follows. `LexRawString`
removes the closing line's indentation from each content line of a `"""` string
and normalizes `\r\n` to `\n`. Its token and the resulting `StrLit` record
whether it was multiline, allowing `embed_shader` to report errors at the
corresponding source line.

**Parser** (`parser.h`): recursive descent mirroring Appendix D, one
function per construct. Points that matter to later passes:

* Statement termination (§2) is `stmt_level`/`stmt_ended`: a block-ended
  construct on a statement's spine ends the statement, so no operator or
  postfix continues it. `no_struct_lit` implements the Rust rule for
  scrutinee positions.
* `f<` commits to a type argument list only when followed by `(`, `{` or
  `.ident {`; `>>` closing two generic lists is split by
  `ExpectClosingAngle`.
* Namespaces (`docs/design/namespaces.md`): a qualified reference is
  interned as one string (`Ident::name` is `"image::Pixel"` as written), so
  it can never coincide with a local; every reference also records the
  namespace it was written in (`Ident::ns`, `TypeName::ns`, `Dot::ns`,
  `Return::ns`), which is where an unqualified name resolves first. A
  declaration may spell its own namespace, which sets `curns` for the rest
  of it.
* Only the root file's `main` is registered; an imported file's is dropped
  at the declaration (§11.1).
* A `guard` is an `if` from the parser on (`ParseGuard`, §6.4): the rest of
  the block it is in parses as the if's then-block, its `else` block as the
  if's, and the if takes the guard's place, as the block's tail where the
  rest ends in one and as its last statement otherwise. No later pass has a
  guard node, and `--dump` prints the `if`. A guard anywhere but among a
  block's statements is a parse error.
* Imports are collected per file; `ParseProgram` resolves `import a.b` against
  the root file's directory then the stdlib directories (`StdlibDirs`), and
  `import .a.b` against the importing file, loads each file once, and
  stable-sorts `ast.globals` by a post-order walk of the import graph so an
  imported file's globals initialize first.

Import traversal visits a file's imports in source order; an edge to a file
already being visited contributes no second visit. This also determines
the initializer order in import cycles. Within a file, declaration order
is preserved. Name visibility does not make a global initialized: its
`VarDef` exists from the start, so names resolve in any order, but has no
type and is unassigned until the driver checks its declaration. Naming it
before then, to read or to write, in its own initializer or through a
called function too, fails definite assignment (`RequireAssigned`, which
`Ident::Check` asks of every variable and `CheckLValue` of a global before
reading its type). The standard-library search order in `StdlibDirs` is
`--stdlib`, `GOOSE_STDLIB`, `stdlib/` beside the executable and up to three
ancestors, then `stdlib/` in the working directory; the first existing
candidate wins, after the root-file-relative candidate.

**Resolution** (`resolve.h`): every parse-time `TY_UNRESOLVED` name is
rewritten in place. A struct or enum name becomes `TY_STRUCT`/`TY_ENUM`; an
alias use is substituted with its target (after a structural cycle check
that treats nominal declarations as boundaries), keeping the use site's line
and adding its `const` qualifier; anything else becomes `TY_GENERIC`, which
the typechecker later validates against the generics in scope -- except a
qualified unknown name, which is an error here since it can only be a
declaration. Variant types (`Shape.Circle`) are resolved last. After this
pass, aliases do not exist as types and "is this an integer" is a kind
comparison.

**Dump** (`dump.h`): `--dump` regenerates source from the parsed tree, and
the test runner checks that dump, reparse and dump again are identical.
Diagnostics name expressions with the same code (`TypeCheck::ExprStr`), as
the user wrote them: under `dumpwritten` the `&` the checker inserts where
an lvalue binds by reference (`Unary::synth`, §3.3) is left out, which
`--specs` still shows.

## 3. The typechecker

### 3.1 Whole-program checking in call-graph order

The typechecker (`TypeCheck`, `typecheck.h`) checks the program from its
roots: the `TypeCheck` constructor creates a `VarDef` for every global up
front (so names resolve in any order), resolves the pools named by relative
reference types, validates every non-generic struct and enum declaration,
checks the global initializers in order (a `var` global declared with only
a type gets its type's default value there, `DefaultValue`, which the rest
of the compiler sees as written), then `main`, then every
`thread_fn`, and finally eligible functions nothing reached (`CheckUnreached`).
That last check covers only top-level functions with fully annotated
parameters, no generics, and no syntactically detected `return from` to an
outside target. Unused generic and nested bodies are checked only when
instantiated. The standalone check roots each reference, slice and holder
parameter at a class of its own at the globals' depth, as a call from the
global initializers passing distinct globals would, with writable
provenance, and gives eligible grow-only parameters both reusable-pool
capabilities; it is not evidence that every possible call is valid.
Two whole-program fixups run after that: `SettleParamRootExactness`
(§3.4) and `VerifyLiterals` (§3.12).

A function is checked once per **specialization** (`FnSpec`, `ast.h`), and
a specialization is created at a call site, when a call resolves to a
function and no existing specialization matches. `GetOrCreateSpec`
(`typecheck_calls.h`) is the one place that decides the key:

| Part of the key | What it records |
|---|---|
| `lexparent` | the lexical environment a nested function is declared in: a specialization, or a function value's body as one check of its call sees it (`FnSpec::isfunval`, §3.12); none for one declared right in a global initializer, whose frame has none (§3.12) |
| `argtypes` | the concrete parameter types after generic inference |
| `bindings` | the concrete type of each of the function's own type variables, explicit or inferred, in any order: the only record of one no parameter type mentions (`size<u8>()`) |
| `roots` (`RootArg` per parameter) | the reference root *class* of each reference, slice or reference-holding argument, where the class's depth stands (`depthkey`), its writability, `reusable` and grow-shrink provenance, whether it is a `bytes_of` view, and the global pool it is rooted in (§3.4) |
| `litparams` | which parameters are literal parameters (§7.7) |
| `fnvals` | the identity of each bound function value (the block node or named function, plus the environment it captures) |
| `narrowedenv` | which optionals of the lexical environment were narrowed at the call (a nested function or block sees them narrowed) |
| `envreads` | the state of each variable outside the body's activation that it names, or that a callee checked or reused for it named, as the body's check began with it: assigned or not, for a `let` whether it may be assigned (§3.9), where it points (`ref`, `refrootknown`), what it holds (`contents`). A nested function's free variables are hidden parameters (§7.5), a global initializer's locals among them when a function declared or a function value written there reads them: a later call finding one otherwise gets a body of its own. Filled by `NoteEnvRead` (`LookupVar`) and `NoteCalleeEnvReads` (after each call), shared among a cycle's members (`ShareCycleEnvReads`), compared by `EnvUnchanged`. The same variables as the check left them (`envexits`) are where a call reusing the body leaves them (`ReplayEnvExits`). A body that stored a value rooted at one of its parameters' classes into such a variable serves only the call it was checked for (`FnSpec::storesout`, §3.5) |
| `needs` | the concrete specializations of every `return ... from` target enclosing the call must be the same on this path |

`RootArg::exact` and `RootArg::concrete` are excluded from the key: they are
ANDed over every call site that reaches the specialization, and only codegen
(section 6.10) and the growth checks (§3.10) read them. A back edge into a
specialization still being checked (`inprogress`) reuses it whatever its roots
(§3.11).

`CheckSpecBody` checks one body. It pushes a `Frame` (the function, its
specialization, the lexical specialization and frame index used for free
variable lookup, the call line for diagnostics), creates the parameter
`VarDef`s with their synthetic class roots, records or infers the return
types, seeds the cycle return roots where the function is `recursive`,
clones the body, checks its statements, and treats a value-producing tail as
`return tail`. Per-body state is saved on entry and restored on exit: pending shrinks,
held temporaries, reachability, the construction
destination, the slot and return flags (§3.8), and narrowings of outer
variables; the outer variables it assigns are left assigned where all of
its exits agree, and maybe assigned where any of them may be (§3.9). Only
the specialization's effect summaries reach the caller.

**Depth.** Since a body is checked inside the call that first reaches it,
the native stack holds a `CheckSpecBody` activation for every call on the
compile-time call path, and between two of them the frames of the statements
and expressions around the call. Recursion deepens it only so far (a back
edge reuses the specialization in progress, and a recursion whose types
never repeat stops at `MAXNESTEDSPECS`, §3.11 below), but a chain of
distinct functions is as long as a program makes it, a generated one
especially. `CheckSpecBody` first compares the stack pointer with
`stackfloor` (`utils.h`), which the driver sets `STACKHEADROOM` (4 MB) short
of the end of the compile thread's 64 MB stack (§1 above), and below it
reports "compile-time call path too deep for the compiler's stack" with the
number of calls nested. The headroom holds whatever a body nests below the
check and the error's unwinding. How many calls fit depends on the frames
the C++ compiler made, including local variables from branches that the
call path never takes: in a Debug build those can still occupy stack slots
for the whole activation. `Binary::Check` therefore checks ordinary operands
in a small frame; reference identity, short-circuit flow and result checking
live in separate helpers, so their temporaries do not accumulate along a
chain of calls in arithmetic operands. CI checks and runs a chain of 2,000
functions shaped `let a: i64[1] = [x]; next(a[0], n - 1) + 1`, and requires
a chain of 6,000, each calling the next from 32 blocks deep, to report the
depth error. Each activation also retains its cloned body, variables and
records, so increasing the stack size alone would have limited benefit.
The optimizer's `Reach` and BCE's `BuildCallGraph` walk the same call graph
recursively, with smaller frames, unchecked.

**Frames, scopes and variables.** `frames` is the compile-time call path;
`scopes` is one flat vector for the whole path (a frame records where its
scopes begin), so `CurDepth()` -- the scope count -- increases monotonically
from `main` inward. `vars` is the flat vector of every variable in scope on
the path, with per-frame bases; `LookupVar` searches the current frame's
scopes innermost-out, then what the body sees outside them (`ForOuterVars`):
a nested function's body the variables in scope at its declaration
(§3.12), a function value's body those of the frame it is written in as
they are at the call, and so on outward, marking the variable `captured`;
then, unless a type parameter or a nested function of the name hides them
(`ScopeNameKind`, §11.1), the globals by the namespace rules. A name that
is no variable is then a type parameter (`LookupTypeParam`: the lexical
binding chain, innermost first, bound to a type or a function value), a
nested function or a function, which `Ident::Check` and `CheckNamedCall`
try in that order. `localfns` holds nested function declarations with the
scope they were declared in; `Scope::serial` tells a scope from a later
one at the same index. `blockpos` keeps the statement
index of every open block, which the shrink rules' liveness scan (§3.10)
reads.

**Diagnostics.** `TypeCheck::Error` appends the offending source line and
the instantiation chain: every real frame from innermost outward, with the
specialization's argument types (literal parameters marked) and the call
site it was instantiated from (§7.7). The argument types show the binding
of every type variable a parameter type names; the rest of `bindings`,
from an explicit list, and every function value in `fnvals` follow the
function's name in declaration order, since distinct specializations would
otherwise print alike: `size<u8>()` and `size<f64>()` on one line read
`in fn size<T = u8>()` and `in fn size<T = f64>()`, `fn scale<T, U>(t: T)`
reads `in fn scale<U = u8>(f64)`, and `apply(3, wide)` reads
`in fn apply<F = wide>(i64)`. A block has no name, and two can share a
line, so it prints as the file, line and column of its `{`, as in
`in fn apply<F = {block at x.goose:4:24}>(i64)` (the column is
`FunVal::col`; `Line` has none). A value passed on under another generic's
name prints as the function or block it is. A function whose type
variables all appear in its parameter types, and that binds no function
value, prints no list. `DumpInstance` writes a frame's specialization this
way, and names the one a call would create in the polymorphic recursion
error (§3.11). Each type is cut short at 200 characters (`DumpShort`): the
text of one a runaway recursion built can be exponentially longer than the
type. A chain longer than `MAXCHAIN` (20) shows its innermost and outermost
ten and counts the rest.

### 3.2 Types, instantiation, and size classes

`TypeExpr` (`ast.h`) is a kind plus a per-kind detail; the `cq` bit is the
`const` qualifier of §9.5 and is part of type identity (`TypeEq`), except
where a parameter or result is compared (`TopConstEq`: constness of the
type itself is inferred per instantiation, constness nested deeper is part
of the type) and where a value other than a reference or slice is stored
whole (`FitsAt`: the slot's type says whether its contents are read-only).
`Subst` substitutes generic names through the lexical binding
chain (`LookupBinding`: the current specialization, then its lexical
parents), collapsing a reference built on a type argument that is itself
one: `T?` makes it optional and `T&` is it, loaded where relative (no
references to references, §3.8); `ownexclude` keeps a callee's own generic
names from resolving to an enclosing function's same-named binding while a
call is unified;
`WithBindings`/`bindonly` restrict substitution to an instantiation's own
bindings while its field types are computed.

`GetStructInst`/`GetEnumInst` (`typecheck_types.h`) instantiate a nominal
type once per argument list (cached on the `TypeStruct`/`TypeEnum` detail
and searched by argument equality for clones), substitute the field types,
validate them, and compute the derived properties every later pass reads:

* the **size class** (`ClassOf`): a resizable field only as the last real
  field, making the struct resizable; any variable-class part makes it
  variable; `varint` fields and varint-width relative references are
  variable-class; a limited array is fixed with a static capacity and
  variable with `[..]`; a fixed-mode enum is fixed, a variable-mode one is
  its `varclass`;
* `flat` (no references anywhere), what threads and queues require;
* `frameobj` (C.2): a resizable-tailed struct whose other fields are all
  fixed-size and free of relative references, and whose tail is an array or
  itself a frame object -- the shape codegen keeps in the frame as a C
  struct with the tail's header last;
* `validated`, which is false while the instantiation is being built and so
  detects a struct or enum that contains itself by value, and per variant
  `vbuilt`, which does the same for a variant type held by value in a
  payload of its own enum (`BuildVariant` validates a variant's payload
  where the enum's build reaches it, or earlier where such a payload holds
  it). A reference's or slice's pointee waits (`laterpointees`) until the
  outermost instantiation being built is done, so an instantiation still
  being built is always one the type at hand contains by value, never one
  a reference leads back to (§3.4): `enum L { Nil, Cons { next: L? } }`
  checks the pointee `L` once `L` is built, fixed-size payloads and all,
  and `struct A { b: B? }` declared before `struct B { a: A }` builds `B`
  after `A`;
* concrete field types; defaults are checked at each construction site
  (`CheckDefaultInit`), with declaration-scope bindings and caller effects.

A declaration whose fields name it with a larger type argument each round
(spec §3.2) would instantiate without end: by value through recursion,
through a reference through `laterpointees`, which never empties. So the
chain of instantiations that led to an instance is kept: `typechain` holds
the types being built, and a waiting pointee the chain it was met on.
`LimitNestedInsts` refuses an instance whose chain already holds
`MAXNESTEDSPECS` (16) of its declaration, as `GetOrCreateSpec` does for a
function (§3.11), naming the first three.

`ValidateType` enforces the placement rules of §3.3/§3.4 per position
(`ValidPos`): `varint` only in fields, elements and pointees; fixed, limited
and grow-shrink arrays need fixed-size elements; variable and grow-only
arrays may not hold resizables; an enum with non-fixed payloads is only
usable in variable mode, and so is one whose payloads hold self-relative
references (`EnumInst::selfrel`, from `HasRelRefT` over each payload field
in `BuildVariant`): fixed mode binds its payloads by value only, and a copy
does not keep them (§3.5, §3.9). A payload-less variant constant of such an
enum is variable-mode (`CheckVariantConst`). A resizable enum binds its
payloads by value only as well, a whole assignment replacing its variant
(§4.4, `CheckMatch`), so `GetEnumInst` rejects an instance whose `varclass`
is resizable where a payload that is not itself resizable holds them, at
the enum's declaration once all variants are built. A resizable payload,
which the C backend does not bind at all yet, is left alone.

An array literal uses its destination's type when one is available.
Otherwise it is a `T[k]` for fixed-size elements or a `T[]` for non-fixed
elements, which cannot use `T[k]`. Without an expected element type, the
first element supplies it and later elements must fit it; there is no
search for a common wider element type. `[]` and `null` alone do not infer
a generic argument type. A string literal's natural type is `const u8[:]`;
the pending-array rule below deliberately chooses an owned string element
instead. Array adaptation requires equal element types, not elementwise
numeric conversions. Fixed-array destinations require their exact length;
an arbitrary slice is not implicitly checked and converted into `T[k]`.
A fixed literal at a slice destination is a temporary
codegen holds in a C local and slices whole. A `T[]` literal has no such
temporary: `NoTemporaryLiteral` rejects it at a slice destination, as a
`for` iterable, as the base of a path (`[..]`) and as `bytes_of`'s argument,
the places that would view it (spec §4.2). The whole slice `==` takes of an
operand to compare two array kinds (`WholeSlice`, marked `cmpview`) may
view one: codegen builds the literal on a statement-scoped stack, like a
call result, and the comparison's result holds no view of it.

`append` names its literal argument's type (`AppendedRun`): the run of the
receiver's elements it adds, a `T[k]`, or a `T[]` where they are not
fixed-size, checked with the receiver as its destination (`CheckValueAt`),
as a pushed element is, so a reference in it obeys the store rule and a
relative one may point into the receiver. Any other source is checked as it
stands and must already be an array or slice of the element type; the
elements it adds are copies (`AppendedCopies`). What the references in them
point at is fitted to the receiver as a store (`MustFit` under the
receiver's `Dest`): an array's holder root, as a copy of the whole array
has, and out of a slice or reference, each element as `ContainerRead` reads
it out of the storage viewed.

**Pending arrays.** `var out = [];` (§4.2) gets a grow-only array type whose
element is a private void type (`PendingArray`); the first `push`, `append`,
`format` or whole assignment overwrites the element type *in place*
(`CompletePending`), which completes it in the `VarDef`, in every `Ident`
already checked and in the literal, since all of them share the one type
object. A pending array that reaches a scope exit uncompleted is an error.
Anywhere else a `[]` checked without an array type to take is the
fixed-size placeholder `void[0]` (`Val::emptyarr`), which a consumer with a
type checks again at that type: an argument at the parameter type overload
resolution finds for it (`UnifyArg`). A construct whose branches are all
such literals is one as well (`MergeVals` keeps the flag, as it keeps a
null's), so it takes a parameter's type too; a `[]` beside a branch of
another type is an error, since unlike a constant it adapts to none. Codegen
could not build the placeholder, so every consumer with no type to give
rejects it (`IsUntypedEmptyArray`, `NoUntypedEmptyArray`): the value of a
function value's body (`CheckFunValCall`), a value an omitted result type is
taken from (`CheckInferredResult`), a statement, a binary operator's
operand, a member, index or slice of it, a `for`'s sequence, a rendered
value, a member builtin's receiver, `qput`'s element, an element or fill of
an array literal no destination types, and a variable's initializer other
than a `var`'s whole `[]`. The others reject it by its type, which a
diagnostic shows as the literal (`TypeStr`).

**Named initializer order.** `CheckInits` resolves names and checks each
initializer in declaration order, the order codegen evaluates and constructs
them directly in their destinations. It then checks each source-order inversion
with `InitOrderSafe`: both expressions, and any omitted defaults between their
fields, must be free of observable effects, runtime failures and nonlocal exits.
`InitOrderStoreSafe` also checks destination adaptations, including capacities,
length prefixes and relative offsets, at field, argument, return and local slots.
This conservative AST proof follows completed callees with a recursion guard;
unknown calls, mutation, loops and potentially failing operations are barriers.
It is independent of optimization and treats debug-only failures as barriers too.
No source-order staging or extra copies are emitted.

**Defaults.** An omitted optional field is null even without an explicit
default. Other omitted fields need a declared default, unless the literal
ends in `..` (`StructLit::defaultall`, which `default<T>()` also sets on
the literal it synthesizes): a field without one then gets its type's
default value (`DefaultValue`), null for an optional reference, a
`default<T>()` call for another fixed-size type, and otherwise `[]` for an
array, 0 for a varint, or a literal of its struct, variant or first variant
ending in `..` in turn; one whose type has no default value (`HasDefault`)
is an error naming the field. A declared
default resolves in its type declaration's namespace and generic bindings,
with access to globals, not the constructor's locals or sibling fields.
It is evaluated at each construction that uses it, in field order among
the explicit initializers, not once when the type is instantiated.
`default<T>()` recursively applies declared defaults, selects variant zero,
and fills fixed arrays; empty limited arrays do not construct unused slots.
The effects of executing a default must participate in the same lifetime,
construction and optimization checks as an explicit initializer. The
checked expressions are part of that construction's tree, including
`default<T>()` and slice-pool initialization. Unused defaults are checked
when a construction first uses them, not merely on type instantiation.
A parameter's default is checked in the same kind of frame
(`DefaultScope`), at each call leaving it out (§3.12).

Each check of a default checks anew what it constructs and calls, with
their defaults, and the blocks and functions written in it, so a default
reaching a use of itself there would be checked without end.
`EachDefaultInPlace` walks the frames of the defaults the current code runs
in: from a default's frame to the frame of its construction or call, from
a function value's or nested function's body to the frame it was written
in (`lexframe`), and no further than a top-level function's body.
`CheckDefaultInit` rejects a field default (`Frame::defaultfield`, the
declaration's `Field`, so any instantiation) found there, and
`InParamDefault` a parameter's (`defaultfn`, `defaultparam`), both naming
the chain: `InstantiationChain` lists field defaults' frames with the
literal and the type it builds (`LitTypeStr`), as it lists parameter
defaults'. Through a top-level function's body a default leading back to
itself is a recursion (§3.11), which the cache of specializations keeps
finite, or MAXNESTEDSPECS where every round makes a new one; flagging it
there would depend on whether the function's body was first checked
inside the default or before it.

### 3.3 Values, lvalues, and reference transparency

Every `Check` returns a `Val` (`ast.h`): the type, the constant value where
the expression folds, the literal flags (`strlit`, `emptyarr`, `isnull`,
`unsized`), `lvalue` (denotes storage), `nonneg` (§3.14), the holder fields
(§3.5), what a control construct's branches are (`storagebranches`,
`implicitcopy`, §3.12; `joinslice` and its companions, §3.4), and a
`Prov` -- the provenance of §3.4.

References are transparent (§3.8), which the checker implements as
*decay*: `CheckV` is the raw per-node check whose result may still denote a
reference; every consumer goes through `CheckValue`, `CheckArg` or `Operand`
(`typecheck_exprs.h`), which load the pointee (`DecayRef`) unless the
destination keeps the reference (`KeepsRef`: a reference-typed destination,
or a whole-array reference meeting a slice destination). A condition
(`CheckCond`), an integer `match`'s scrutinee (`CheckMatch`) and a `for`
loop's count (`CheckFor`) decay the same way; a reference to an ADT
scrutinee is kept, its tag and payload read where the value lies, and so is
one to the array or slice a `for` iterates in place. The node's `exprtype`
is then the pointee's type, which codegen follows: a written `&x` there
reads as `x` (`Unary::CgX`).
`CheckValue` also:

* retains `copy(x)` as a call, so repeated checking preserves copy intent;
* binds a non-fixed lvalue to a reference destination by rewriting the node
  to a synthesized `&node` (`AutoRef`, `Unary::synth`), so every later pass
  sees an ordinary reference argument, and warns on a redundant user `&`;
* keeps a reference to a non-fixed value undecayed where an un-annotated
  `let`/`var` takes it (`CheckValue`'s `inferred` flag, `IsNonFixedRef`):
  the pointee is a non-fixed lvalue, which such a binding takes by
  reference (§4.1), so the variable is that reference, exactly as with `.=`;
  `CheckVarDecl` keeps a multi-value binding's such results the same way,
  and `CheckInferredResult` a return's or body tail's value that a result
  type is inferred from (§7.1), which it takes as an un-annotated `let`
  takes its initializer in the other cases too: an explicit `&x` as it is,
  a non-fixed lvalue other than the function's own local (`IsOwnLocal`) by
  `AutoRef`. Such a reference into storage the function owns, or into a
  temporary, is rejected there with a `copy` hint, before `RecordReturn`
  would reject its root;
* rejects a non-fixed lvalue at a value destination unless it is a `copy`
  or the function's own local being returned, by a `return` or as the
  body's tail (`RequireCopyable`, §4.1; `inreturn`, which the statements,
  conditions, scrutinees and `for` loops inside the returned value clear,
  and a valued `block` or `loop` keeps for its breaks' values), and so a
  branch's value, or a reference to it, where its construct has no
  destination type and the construct's value is a copy of it
  (`CheckValue`'s `branchcopy` flag, `CheckBranchCopy`);
* warns on a branch's redundant `&x` where its construct has no destination
  type and copies the fixed-size pointee (`branchcopy` again);
* fits the value to the destination (`MustFit`/`FitsAt`, §3.5); the node's
  `exprtype` becomes the destination's type, which can be wider than the
  type its operation computes at (an `i8` cast stored into an `i64`), so
  that type is read elsewhere: a cast's `AsCast::totype`, an operator's
  operands' `exprtype`. An array, or a reference to one, meeting a slice
  of its element type is a whole-array slice of it (`FitsAt`), whatever the
  destination, `const` where the array is read-only and no pool (as `a[..]`
  is not, `Val::reusable`), which the store and constness rules then judge
  as the slice it is. A generic struct literal binds a slice field's
  element type through it, as `UnifyArgRaw` does a slice parameter's;
* rejects copies of values holding self-relative references
  (`NoRelRefCopy`, §3.13).

Lvalue paths (`CheckLValue`, `LValueBase`) resolve `Ident`/`Dot`/`Index`
chains to an `LVal`: the location's type, its owning variable when it is a
bare name, its provenance, whether it is `let`-bound, whether it starts at a
by-value binding, whether it was reached through a field or element step
(`fromstorage`), whether it is the tail of a frame object held as one, with
a header of its own (`fotail`, `FieldsInFrame`), whether it is a
`varint`, and, for a path into a temporary, where what the temporary holds
points (`intemp`, §3.6). Crossing a reference on the way (`DerefLValue`)
replaces the provenance by the reference's: a reference *variable*'s
committed binding (§3.7), or, for a reference read out of storage, the
read-back root and the writability its slot gives (`ReadBackLVal`, §3.6,
§3.8); and the rest of the path lies in the reference's pointee, whose type
it notes (`Prov::reached`, §3.5), as a slice crossed notes its element type
(`SliceProvenance`). `ContainerRead` is the load of a field or element: the
load type (`LoadType`: `varint` decodes to `i64`, a relative reference loads
as a plain one, a `const` value loads as a plain copy), the read-back
provenance, and, for a reference or slice, the writability its slot gives.
The load of a `varint` is marked (`Val::isvarint`) and read-only: bound by
reference it is the `varint&` its storage type makes (`StorageType`, which
`BindsRef`, `AutoRef`, `FitsAt` and `UnifyArgRaw` bind by), never an `i64&`.
What a reference to one loads is marked too (`DecayRef`), so a construct
whose branches are such references binds as `varint&` at a reference
parameter. Neither is `i64` storage: a format overload taking an `i64` by
reference is rooted at a read-only temporary (`CheckPrintable`), which
codegen fills with the decoded value (`EmitUserFormat`). A varint part of
a printed value keeps its own type, which no `i64` overload takes.

**The statement's operands.** Values evaluated earlier in a statement stay
live until the operation consuming them ends, and what runs later in the
statement is part of a variable's liveness; both are read off the tree
rather than recorded along the way. The checker keeps the path of nodes it
is inside (`nodepath`, one `PathEntry` per node with the count of its
operands evaluated so far, entered by `NodeScope` in `CheckV`, `CheckStmt`,
`CheckStmtExpr` and `CheckLValue`) and the checked value of every
expression that points somewhere (`nodevals`, `RecordVal`). `ForOperands`
states each node kind's operands in evaluation order with how the node
consumes them (`HoldKind`: a value, a view of an array's elements as `==`
takes, the elements an index or slice reaches, a builtin's receiver, an
assignment's location, the sequence a `for` walks), `HeldOperands` walks
the path and hands every operand already evaluated to the shrink checks as
its parent holds it (`HoldAs`: a reference or slice as it is, a holder as a
reference per pointee, the receiver as a reference to the array or a view of
its elements, a location as the slot alone), and `LaterOperands` names the
operands not yet evaluated, and, inside the condition of an `if`, the
scrutinee of a `match` or the sequence of a `for`, the parts it leads to
(`AfterHead`; `UsedAfter`, §3.10). A `for`'s sequence is the one operand
held over a construct's parts, while its body is checked
(`HoldForSequence`, §6.5): codegen spells the path to it into the loop
(`ForLoop::CgStmt`, `GenLoc`), so each reference or slice the path loads
out of a field or element (a `Dot` or `Index` of such a type, `&` of a path
being the path) is held as a view of the storage it lies in
(`Held::reread`), and the sequence as a view of its elements, unless it is
a variable, which the loop names and so the scans see, or a resizable
array, whose length the loop reads again. A struct literal lays all its
initializers out, defaults included, before checking the first
(`CheckInits`), so each field stands at its own position among them. A call
resolving its overload is `discovering`: its operands' values are those its
phase 2 checks, and a call applying its callee's summary has consumed its
own operands, which the callee's parameter pairs judge (§3.10). A callee
body checked meanwhile starts with an empty path (`CheckSpecBody`), the
caller's statement being its own: the call site applies the summary against
it.

### 3.4 Roots and provenance

The lifetime system of §9 is one record on every reference-like value:

```
struct RootAlt {         // one place the value may point
    VarDef *root;        // the variable whose scope bounds the pointee; null = static data
    bool exact;          // root's own storage holds the pointee (else it only outlives it)
    VarDef *from;        // for an inexact read-back: the container, for diagnostics
    bool slotread;       // read out of a field, an element or a global (§3.10)
    bool classread;      // read out of the storage a parameter's class stands for (§3.10)
};
struct Roots {
    vector<RootAlt> alts;   // every place the value may point, one per root
};
struct Prov : Roots {
    bool writable;       // §9.5
    int reusable;        // the root is a reusable pool (§5.4): RU_SLOTS or RU_SLICES bits
    bool byteview;       // a bytes_of view over typed storage
    TypeExpr *reached;   // the pointee type of the last reference or slice its path crossed (§3.5)
};
```

A value that may point at several places -- an `if`'s branches, a
variable's bindings, a function's returns, the candidates a read out of a
container has (§3.6) -- has an alternative per root, and every rule asks
each alternative: a store must outlive the destination by every one
(`FitsAt`), a shrink frees what any one points into (§3.10), a value is
storable inside a recursive cycle only where every one is (`CycleStorable`),
and it names one array (`Roots::Exact`) only with a single, exact
alternative. `Roots::Root` is the innermost alternative's root, the one
scope every alternative outlives, which diagnostics name and a single
bound stands for. Empty roots are a value with no provenance (a null, or no
reference at all), which every rule lets pass as static data would.

`Roots::Same` compares alternatives as a set, independent of the order
branches or recursive rounds discover them. Ordinary equality compares all
provenance, including `unknown`; `Prov` adds its permissions and view flags
through defaulted equality. Two explicit projections cover the other uses:
cycle convergence ignores `from`, whose local containers are recreated,
while global reachability compares only roots, exactness and source
containers, which are the fields that analysis reads. A merge of alternatives
reports change by comparing the complete result with its previous value, so
weakening any provenance fact feeds back into the surrounding analysis.
Joining a previously unknown discovery state also reports a change, even
before that state has any alternatives; joining it again is idempotent.

**Depth.** Every `VarDef` has a `depth`: 0 for globals, else the scope count
at its creation along the current compile-time call path. Because scopes
accumulate along the path, a callee's locals are always deeper than
anything its caller passed, and "A outlives B" is `Depth(A) <= Depth(B)`
for variables live together on one path. One sentinel has the largest
depth: `temproot` (what a reference variable not bound yet points at).

**Temporaries.** A value made without a name -- a literal or a call's
result, `str`'s text, a popped element -- is rooted at a `VarDef` of its
own (`TempRoot`, `istemp`), one past the depth of the scope it is made in:
codegen frees it when its statement ends (§6.2), or the block whose tail
made it, so it outlives the variables of the scopes that statement opens (a
`for` body over it, a `match` arm on it) and not the ones the statement
itself declares. What it holds is read back where it points (`intemp`,
§3.6), and a store record never names a temporary as the source of what it
holds (`RecordStore`): nothing on record describes a temporary's contents,
so the stored value's own root bounds them.

The by-value result of an `if`, `match`, block, loop or bare `{ }`, of a
function value's call, and of `copy(x)` and `default<T>()` (but a null
reference's or an empty slice's, which are static data), is such a
temporary too: codegen builds it in storage of its own (`CtlValX`,
or `GenLoc` for any other value it addresses), copying a branch's value
there even where the branch names a variable. `TempCopy` roots a
construct's value, a function value's call's (`CheckFunValCall`) and a
default there, and `CheckBuiltin` a copy, keeping what it holds
pointing where the source's contents do; it is read-only and no `lvalue`,
as a call's result is, so nothing binds it by reference or writes it in
place. A slice value keeps its roots and writability, pointing where the
branch's does, but not the branch's slot (`Val::slot`): the slot holding
it is the temporary, which a `format` overload taking it by reference is
given (`CheckPrintable`). A reference parameter binds a construct's
branches themselves instead (`BindBranchesByRef`, §3.12). Where the
optimizer folds a construct to the branch taken,
`OptViewed` keeps a viewed value a copy (section 4, "Views of copies"),
which is what lets the shrink rules take a view of it for a view of the
temporary alone.

A construct whose branches are arrays and slices of one element type is no
such copy: its value is a slice of that element (spec §6.4), each array
branch a whole-array slice of itself (`FitsAt`, spec §3.10), rooted
where the array is, so `CheckBranchRoot` holds the array to the
construct's scope. With a slice destination type the branches are simply
checked against it. With none, which branches join is known only once all
of them are checked, so the construct's `Check` (`CheckJoin`) checks them
twice where they do: a first time as they are, the construct on `joinpath`
-- the construct and each branch value it checks next, a construct there
included, like `argpath` (§3.12) -- where `JoinBranches` merges a slice and
an array, or arrays of two types, into a value that is only a slice type
(`Val::joinslice`; `joinhasslice` where a branch is a slice of its own), and
then a second time against that type, from the flow state before the first,
with no destination for stores and no typed slot (the value's receiver
judges it). A construct on `joinpath` is part of the first construct's
check: it leaves its value uncopied (`TempCopy` is the first construct's
to apply where nothing joins) and its joins to it. Until the first check
is known to stand, its warnings are held (`BodyState::joinprobes`, as
loop passes hold theirs, §3.7) and the copies of non-fixed storage it would
report are noted (`CheckBranchCopy` defers them on `joinpath` as on
`argpath`) and reported after it; the growths and shrinks it logged for the
values under construction around the construct (`growlog`, §3.10) are
dropped, the second check logging them again. Arrays of two types with no
slice among them join only for a parameter declared a slice, so a
construct on `argpath` leaves such a join to its call (`NoArrayJoin`,
§3.12) and every other one reports them as mismatched there. Each `break`
after the first is checked against the first's type (spec §6.4) unless
that joined arrays (`CheckBreak`), and one agreeing with a slice type
where the construct has no destination type is stored nowhere by that, as
a branch of an `if` would not be.

**Where a root comes from:**

| Expression | Root | Exact |
|---|---|---|
| a variable `x` (`Ident::Check`) | `x` | yes |
| `&lvalue` (`CheckRefOf`), or an lvalue bound by reference (`AutoRef`, a slice's slot being `Val::slot`) | the lvalue's owner | as the path |
| a reference or slice variable (`RefProvOf`) | its committed binding (§3.7); for a global `var` used in a function's body, the read-back rule (`GlobalVarRead`) | its binding's, weakened by rebinds; the read-back's |
| a reference read out of a field or element (`ContainerRead`) | the read-back rule (§3.6) | only with one candidate |
| a slice loaded through a reference to one (`SlotView`) | for a reference to a slice variable, that variable's binding; behind a parameter's class that has a class for the slice its slot holds (below), the binding of the variable standing for that slice (`VarDef::heldslice`); out of a field or element, the read-back rule; behind any other parameter's class or a temporary, the root as a bound | as that |
| `a.push(v)`, `a.alloc_ref(v)`, `&a[i]` | `a`'s root | `a`'s exactness |
| `a.alloc_slice(n)`, `a.realloc_slice(s, n)` | `a`'s root | `a`'s exactness |
| `a[lo..hi]` (`SliceExpr::Check`) | `a`'s root | `a`'s exactness |
| a call result (`CallResult`) | every root the callee's returns give (`RetRoot::alts`), mapped (`RetAltVal`: a parameter's class back to the argument's roots at this site -- at a back edge, every argument the class's parameters get -- a global or captured local as itself, null as static data, which at a back edge only bounds the result: the key gave a parameter static data that the back edge may give other storage) and united as branches are (`MergeVals`) | only where they all map to one root exactly |
| an `if`, `match`, `block` or `loop` value of reference or slice type (`MergeVals`), array branches joined as a slice included (`CheckJoin`) | every one of its branches' roots, an array's where it is stored | only where they all name one root exactly |
| an array, struct or variant literal, and a call's value result | a temporary (`TempRoot`): whatever views it rather than being built from it views a temporary | no |
| any other `if`, `match`, `block`, `loop` or bare `{ }` value, a function value's call, and a `default<T>()` but a null reference's or an empty slice's (`TempCopy`); `copy(x)` | a temporary (`TempRoot`), holding what the value it copied held | no; a copy's yes |
| a string literal | static data (null) | yes |
| `null` | none (adapts to any optional) | -- |

**Merged roots.** A value that may be any of several -- an `if`'s branches, a
reference variable's bindings before and after a rebind to another root at
its depth (`CheckRefRebindRoot`), the roots a call's callee returns
(`CallResult`) -- has the union of their alternatives (`Roots::Add`): two
alternatives never share a root, and one added for a root already present
keeps the weaker exactness, and names a container it was read out of
(`RootAlt::from`, §3.6) only where both came out of that one: a reference
into a parameter's storage merged with one read out of it may be either,
and no store record says what the first is. A literal's references
(`NoteLitElem`) and a container's contents (`VarDef::contents`) are united
the same way. The rules that ask what storage a root *is* -- the
grow-shrink store rule
(§3.5 rule 3, `GrowShrinkTaint`), the cycle store rule (rule 4,
`CycleStorable`) -- ask every alternative, so nothing a merge kept has to
be carried beside it. What a
parameter's class stands for at a call is the argument's whole set
(`ClassArgRoots`), which is what the callee's stores, shrinks and growths
map back to.

**Parameters and root classes.** A callee never sees the caller's variables;
it sees *classes*. `GetOrCreateSpec` groups the reference, slice and holder
arguments of a call by their root: distinct exact roots get distinct classes
numbered by depth (so a class number is an outlives rank), static data is
class 0, and an argument that is not exact -- one of several alternatives,
or an inexact one -- always gets a class of its own, at the depth of its
innermost alternative -- sharing a class asserts "the same array", which
such an argument does not establish. What a class's grow-shrink array can
hold is part of the key: the element types of the grow-shrink arrays its
root holds (`RootArg::gselems`, a class passed on naming its own root's),
against which the body's store rule and shrink scans test a pointee
(`GrowShrinkCanHold`), so that every call site a body serves gets the same
answer -- `k(bag.n)`, where `bag` holds only an array of `Pt`s, and
`k(others[0].w)`, where `others` holds `i64`s, reach bodies of their own,
and only the first may store its `i64&`. A class whose grow-shrink array is
not its own root's (`RootArg::gsvia`, keyed as well: another alternative's,
one a slice the argument refers to views, or one in what an inexact
alternative's root leads to that the argument may point into or that its
pointee holds, a whole grow-shrink array read back out of a parameter's
storage among them) is taken to hold anything a grow-shrink array could.
Where every place an argument with such a root, or with a pointee holding
one, may point, or for a holder every place its references may, is a slot
read (§3.10), it points into no grow-shrink array's elements all the same:
the key records that (`RootArg::slotread`), and in the body the parameter,
or the holder's contents, is a slot read, which may be stored, while what
the body reaches through it still meets the class's grow-shrink array.
`CheckSpecBody` then creates one synthetic `VarDef` per class,
carrying the call-site root's depth and the key's grow-shrink facts
(`classfrom` remembers the root it came from) and the types its parameters'
references lead to (`classreach`), and
every parameter of the class is bound to it, exactly, within
the body: inside the body a class names one array, whatever the call site.
A holder parameter's class only bounds what it holds, by the deepest root
its references point into, so its contents (`contentexact`, and the store
event that stands for them) are that array exactly only where the argument's
references all point into one (`RootArg::heldexact`, part of the key), and
never in a `recursive fn`, whose back edges reuse the body whatever they
pass.
A reference to a slice is rooted at the slot holding the slice, whether it
binds a slice lvalue by reference (`RefSliceArgs` gives the argument the
slot's roots, as `AutoRef` gives the phase-2 check) or is written `&s`, so its
class stands for a slot of the caller's -- a variable, a field or an element.
Where the body reaches that slot through references alone -- a slice variable
beyond the variables it can name (`EnvReach`), so no global, a temporary, or
a caller's class that has one of these itself (`HasView`) -- and its function
is not `recursive`, the slice the slot holds as the call is made
(`Val::held`) is a class of its own, numbered with the parameters' and keyed
the same way (`FnSpec::views`, its `gselems` its root's), whose
`classreach` is what the slice leads to. The body binds a variable standing
for that slice to it (`VarDef::heldslice`), which a load through the slot's
class sees (`SlotView`) and every store that may write the slot joins
(below); a call maps the class back to what its argument's slot held, as it
maps a parameter's class to the argument (`RetAltVal`, `ApplyCalleeStores`,
`MapLiveShrinks`, `NoteClassUses`, `NoteRootEvent`). Any other slot's class
only bounds the slice loaded through it. A slice parameter given a reference
to a slice takes that slice's root (`LoadSliceArgs`).
Every store event (`AddStoreEvent`, a callee's mapped at its call included)
into the class of a slot with such a variable joins the stored roots to it
(`NoteSlotStore`), and so does one into any other class or bound that can
hold a slice of its type, which may be the same slot where some call site
passes it to both. A store checked in a body nested in it, or in a function
value written there, joins the slot's class as a bound instead, since the
stored roots are that body's own; the call reaching the body maps its record
to precise ones. A loop feeds a join back as it does a rebind (`NoteFact`),
and a nested body reading the variable reads it outside its activation
(`FnSpec::envreads`).
A temporary of the calling statement outlives the call, so its class takes
the body's own outermost depth instead (`ClassDepth`): the body may keep it
in its locals, but not in anything of the caller's. Classes are numbered by
these body depths, so a temporary ranks after every variable here too,
whatever depth it shares with one at the call site.
Whether two *different* classes are different arrays only the call sites
know. Codegen's stack-top caching (section 6.10) and the growth checks (§3.10)
ask `RootArg::exact`/`concrete`, which `SettleParamRootExactness` propagates
through the `via` links after every call site has been seen; the shrink rules
have each call judge the pairs of roots its callee could not tell apart
(§3.10, **Parameters' views**). What a body records against a
class -- a store into it (§3.5), a shrink or a growth of it (§3.10) -- a call
maps back to the root the class stands for there (`ClassArgRoot`): a
reference or slice argument's own, and a holder argument's holder root, what
its references point into; never the holder, which the callee received a
copy of.

**Depth keys.** A body is checked with its first call site's class depths
and then serves every call with the same key, so the key has to hold
everything the body's checks compare those depths with. The class numbers
order the classes, which is not all: the store rule (§3.5) lets a class be
stored into another's storage where the two share a depth and not where it
is merely deeper, a reference or slice variable is rebound only between
roots at one depth (§3.7), a value that may come from either of two classes
(an `if`'s, say, or a call's whose callee returns either) takes the deeper
one's root, the first where they tie, and only a class at depth 0, a
global's, may be stored into a global. A nested function also compares its classes with the depths of the
variables it captures, and a function given a function value does the same
while it checks that value's body. So each class carries `RootArg::depthkey`
as well: its body depth itself where that is within `EnvReach`, the scopes
open in the frames of the lexical environments the body can see -- its
`lexparent` and those its function values were written in, or a global
initializer's frame for a function declared or a block written right in one
(`LexFrame`), which hold every variable it can name outside itself -- with
only 0, the globals, for a body that sees none; past that, its rank among
the distinct depths of the call's classes beyond, negated. Calls with equal
keys agree on every such comparison, and a call that does not gets a
specialization of its own, checked for its depths. A function called once
with a global and once with a local is split even where its body compares
nothing; an extern function, whose body is C, keeps every key 0. A back
edge reuses the specialization in progress whatever its depth keys, as
whatever its classes (§3.11), and they have no say in whether those classes
still describe the arrays it passes (`concrete`).

A class is a **pool class** (`VarDef::poolclass`) when every member is an
exactly rooted reference to a resizable-class value: no function in a
recursive cycle holds such a value across a call into the cycle (§7.8), so
references in a pool class are exempt from the cycle store rule.
`classpool` is the global pool every member is rooted in, when all agree
(§3.13). Any other class whose members are all exactly rooted references or
slices is a **threaded** candidate (`TypeCheck::ThreadedClass`), exempt in
the same way while every call back into its cycle passes it on (§3.11). A
synthetic class root is told from a variable by its `classfrom`: a variable
whose declaration is being checked has no type yet either.

### 3.5 The store rule and the store record

`FitsAt` is where §9.2's store rule is enforced. The **destination** of the
value being checked is `curdst` (`Dest`: a root, its exactness, whether the
destination is a reference variable itself, which makes the operation a
binding rather than a store, and what the path to it reached: the pointee
type of the last reference or slice it crossed, which the slots filled lie
in, `Prov::reached`); it is set by declarations, assignments, element
arguments (`ElemArg`), appends, and literal fields, and cleared to "no
destination" for call arguments and returns -- a parameter dies before its
argument's root, so an argument is never a store. When a reference, slice,
or **holder** value (a by-value struct, array or payload that contains plain
references or slices, `HoldsPlainRef`) meets a destination with a root:

1. a value that points nowhere yet (`Roots::unknown`: a cycle's first
   round, §3.11, or a loop's discovery pass, §3.7) passes, to be checked
   again once it does;
2. every root of the value must be at or above the destination's depth, and
   where the destination has several alternatives or an inexact one, at or
   above the depth of every storage those may stand for (`ShrinkTargets` over the type
   the path reached, or the slot's own where it crossed no reference: each
   exact alternative itself, and for an inexact one its root and each
   read-back candidate at its depth or outside, a parameter's class as the
   bound on the caller's storage behind it). Whatever owns the slot
   holds a value of the type reached, and whatever can hold one can hold the
   slot, so of the storage the slot's type admits this leaves out only what
   the slot cannot be in: beside a borrowed context's table of `Input`s, an
   argument list, which can hold an `Input`'s text but no `Input[>..]`;
3. a reference that may point into a grow-shrink array's elements may be
   bound to a variable but never stored (§5.2, `StoredIntoGrowShrink`: by
   any of its roots but a slot read's (`GrowShrinkTaint`, §3.10), for a
   holder by any root of its contents but a slot read's,
   `GrowShrinkCanHold` with the byte-view exception `MayBeViewed`, and for
   a reference's inexact root, which only bounds it, by a grow-shrink array
   in what that root's storage leads to through references (`BoundReach`),
   or for a
   reference to a slice by what the slice may point into); a global
   reference or slice variable is storage, so binding one is a store here;
4. inside a recursive cycle, only a reference into a global, a pool-class
   parameter or a local of an enclosing non-cycle function
   (`CycleStorable`), or into a threaded parameter class where every class
   among the destination's storages is threaded too (`ThreadStorable`,
   `ThreadedChain`, §3.11), may be stored -- every alternative of the value
   must be one of those -- besides a rebind of the activation's own
   reference variable (§7.8);
5. the store is **recorded**, on each of those storages, one event per
   alternative of the value.

Rule 3 does not wait for a destination: a literal's field or element is
storage wherever the literal lands, so `NoteLitElem` applies it to each one
(`StoredIntoGrowShrink`), in an argument or a result too. A parameter
class created from a root that holds one may point into a grow-shrink array
too (`IsGrowShrinkRoot`), unless every argument it stands for is a slot read
(§3.4), and so may the holder result a back edge gets for
a parameter the entry call gave static data (§3.11). No holder ever holds a
reference into a grow-shrink array, then,
which is what lets the §5.2 shrink scan look at variables only (§3.10), and
what a holder read out of a field or an element holds count as slot reads. Nor
may a variable that points into none be rebound to a value that may
(`CheckRefRebindRoot`): a store or return checked before the rebind -- later
in a loop, through a reference taken to it -- has already let it through.

An inexact root names a scope, not the storage that owns the pointee: a
read-back through a parameter (`t.a[0]` for `t: Top&` with `a:
Cell[>..<]&`, rooted at `t`'s class), the contents of a holder copied out of
a container, a result a callee read out of its parameter. What it bounds
may lie in its own storage or in any storage its references lead to, at
any remove, and so may a grow-shrink array the value points into: `BoundReach`
gives those types, `ReachedThroughRefs` of a variable's type or, for a
parameter's class, of its parameters' types (`VarDef::classreach`). Rule 3
counts every grow-shrink array among them whose elements can hold the
pointee (`BoundReachesGrowShrink`), and the diagnostic says the array is
reached through the root. A holder's own references were each checked where
they were stored, so the rule looks no further for a holder. A byte view
counts every grow-shrink array a byte view can cover, but only where no
field, element or global has held it (`Prov::freshview`): rule 3 lets a byte
view into those only where it covers none, so one loaded out of storage
never does, whatever the per-value `byteview` a recursive call's u8 views
or a holder's contents give it. `bytes_of` makes one, and variables,
branches, rebinds, references to slice variables (`SlotView`), returns and
calls keep it -- a result that is its argument, the argument's -- while a
back edge's u8 result is one whatever its record says.

An assignment through a reference (`PointeeAssign`) stores where the
reference points, which for a reference read out of a field is where the
read-back rule says (`DerefLValue`), not the field's container. Through a
reference to a slice that is the slot it names (`Dest::slot`), which may be
a slice variable's own: each storage the store lands in that is one is
assigned the value as `s = v` would assign it (`StoreIntoSlot`,
`RebindSliceVar`, §3.7), whether the reference names it exactly or only
may. The storage a reference to a slice may name, where it has an inexact
root, includes each slice variable of the slot's type at that depth or
outside that a reference has been made to (`VarDef::slotref`, set by
`SlotRoots` and `&s`, before which nothing can name one) and every global
slice variable, to which a function checked later may make one
(`RootCandidates`' `slots`, which a read-back of a reference to a slice
passes as well, §3.6). A parameter's class stands for a slot of the
caller's: the event says so (`StoreEvent::slot`), and the call assigns each
slice variable among the storages its argument may be (`ApplyCalleeStores`)
what the callee stored, as seen from the call -- a slice the callee loaded
through another reference-to-slice parameter, whose slice's elements hold
no references, is the slice that argument's slot holds (`SlotView`),
anything else of a class the argument as a bound -- until no binding
changes, since the callee's record keeps no execution order. A body nested
in the functions whose variables it names may be storing into one of those
through its class too: each slice variable of the slot's type there, at the
class's depth or outside, that a reference has been made to is assigned the
value at the store, but for what the body loaded through the class itself,
which the slot held already; a body naming such a variable is checked again
for a call after a reference to it is made (`EnvRead::slotref`).

A declaration without a type annotation infers its type from the value, so
`FitsAt` has no destination type to check. `CheckBindingRoot` applies rule 2
instead, to every name in a multi-value declaration as well, and rule 3 to a
global. This prevents a variable from retaining a view of its statement's
temporary. The sentinels pass: a variable may hold what a reference not bound
yet, or a back edge's result, points at.

A branch's value -- an `if`'s branch, a `match` arm, a block's tail, a
`block`'s or `loop`'s breaks -- reaches whatever receives its construct's
value after the scopes the branch opened have ended, and a call's argument
is no exception, although it is no store. `CheckBranchRoot` applies rule 2
to it as the construct closes, against the depth the construct is in: a
variable deeper than that has ended, and so has a temporary made inside
the construct, one deeper than the temporaries of the construct's own
statement, which last (a `match`'s scrutinee among them). A declaration of
such a value meets this rule before `CheckBindingRoot`, so it is what keeps
a variable from viewing a local of the block whose value it is.

The record (`storeevents`, one `StoreEvent` per alternative of each stored
value, program-wide) is what the grow-only shrink rule of §5.1 consults: the
container, the stored alternative's root and exactness, the pointee type,
the byte-view flag, the source container for a holder copy (a copy holds
what its source holds; an inexact read-back's is the container it came out
of, and one out of a parameter's class is bounded by the class, but for
what came out of the storage the class stands for alone, which holds what
that storage holds: `StoreEvent::classread`, §3.10 **Class reads**), and
the line. A source is the one container the value came out of, whose stores
say what it holds (`StoreSource`): a value that may lie in any of several
places, or anywhere a root only bounds, names none (`HolderSource`, which
a `for` or `match` binder's copy takes too, and `ReadBackRoot` and
`SlotView` keep `RootAlt::from` only for a container named exactly, which
a merge keeps only where every value it joins names it), and neither does
one out of a reference or slice variable, which holds what its binding
says, not what a store put there. The stored alternative's own root bounds
such a value. `RecordStore` also maintains
the container's `contents`: the union of every root stored into it so far,
one at a parameter's class marked where every store of it there put views
that class's storage holds (`AddContents`, §3.10 **Class reads**).
A store into a caller's storage -- through a parameter's class root -- is
kept on the specialization as a `classevent`, and `ApplyCalleeStores`
replays it at every call site with the class mapped back to the root it
stands for there (§3.4), what a holder's references point into for a holder
parameter, and only as bounds, with no source of their own, where the class
only bounded the value (`Bounds`). Each adds to the container's `contents`
as a store of the caller's own does, which a loop around the call feeds
back the same way (`NoteFact`, §3.7). A class the callee named as a source
maps to the one container the argument names exactly, if there is one: for
a reference to a slice, the struct or array whose field or element is the
slot, but not a slice variable, whose slot the callee's record bounds
instead; for the class of the slice a slot holds (§3.4), the one container
that slice names exactly. What came out of a class's storage alone still
did where that container is a class of the caller's; the specialization's
one entry for events alike but for that keeps the mark only where each of
them has it (`AddStoreEvent`), and a cycle's rounds compare it
(`SameRecord`). A nested function's store through a
parameter of the function it is declared in, or a function value's through
one of the function it is written in, is into a class of that function's,
not the
callee's: the call keeps it on the caller's own record, its value's roots
mapped, until it reaches the record of the function whose class it is, whose
callers map it. Such a body's store into a variable outside its activation
-- a nested function's into its parents' variables, a function value's into
those of the frame it was written in -- is on that variable's own record.
Where the value is rooted at a class of the body being called (the nested
function's own, or that of the function a function value is handed to),
the call maps the event onto its arguments in place (`ApplyCalleeStores`),
and the variable's `contents` with it: the class means nothing once the
activation has ended, and a merge or a copy of the variable holds what the
call passed, marked where that is one of the views the storage of a class
of the caller's holds (`AddContents`); no class of the callee's is left
there, marked or not. What the mapping adds reaches the loops around the
call (`NoteFact`), while the class, as the body recorded it, reaches only
the loops and rounds of that activation (`ActivationFloor`): a loop calling
the body checks it again in each pass, whose class is new each time. The events
are mapped for one call, so no other call reuses such a check
(`FnSpec::storesout`). A global's `contents` are left as they are, and so
is the reuse of a check storing into globals alone: their stores are judged
through the calls that passed each class (§3.10, item 5). Semantically
this includes stores through slices: writing a
reference into a viewed element changes the caller's container just as
writing through an array reference does. A permutation may preserve the
container's existing contents provenance, but a new incoming reference
must not disappear from its store effects. Only stores read back from the
same container preserve the existing record without adding an incoming root.
An event keeps the type its destination reached (`StoreEvent::reached`),
and one made through a class that only bounds the caller's storage behind
it is marked `bound`. The body checked such a store against one class, as
deep as the argument's root; where that root is inexact, or the event is a
bound one, the call widens the store to every storage the argument's root
may stand for (`ShrinkTargets` over that type), checks the stored value's
mapped root against each, and records it on each, a class of its own
caller's marked `bound` again. For a callee still being checked (a back
edge) it replays the record its cycle's previous round made (`RecordOf`,
§3.11), and none in the first round.

Holder values carry their contents' roots as `Val::contents` (§9.2's
"implicitly generic over the fields' roots"): a literal's are those of its
reference initializers (`NoteLitElem`, `HolderFromLit`); a variable's are
its `contents`, marks included (§3.10 **Class reads**), which hold a loop's
later stores in its next pass (§3.7), or the variable itself as the bound
where nothing was stored there yet, and a global's are rooted at the
globals (the null root, inexact); a container read's are the
container's roots, inexact, slot reads (§3.10) out of a field or an element,
as a `for` or `match` binder's copy's, a popped element's and what `append`
copies out of a slice are, and out of a temporary the temporary's own; a
holder loaded through a reference (`DecayRef`) is a container read of where
the reference points, no slot read; a container read's source is the
container only where the holder lies in exactly one (`Val::holderfrom`),
and where that is the storage a parameter's class stands for, its contents
there are views that storage holds (`RootAlt::classread`, `MarkClassCopy`,
§3.10 **Class reads**); a copy's (`TempCopy`) are its source's; a holder
parameter is keyed by its contents' class like a reference, by whether
that class is exactly the one array they point into, and by whether they
are slot reads (§3.4), and the class (its `ref`) bounds what is read back
out of it or out of a copy of it (§3.6).

### 3.6 Read-back roots

A reference read out of a container names a scope, not the storage it points
into; `ReadBackRoot` (`typecheck_types.h`) re-derives the owner exactly as
§9.5 describes, once, at the read, as one alternative per candidate:

* a self-relative reference inherits the container's root and exactness; an
  `in pool` reference is rooted at its pool, exactly;
* a container whose own root is a global: the candidates are the globals
  whose storage can hold the pointee type by value (`CanContain`: through
  elements and fields, stopping at references and slices, with a relative
  reference's storage holding its own type, which is what a slice of them
  points at), plus static data when the pointee is `u8` and the reference or
  slice read back is `const`, or nothing else can hold the pointee (a writable
  one is given static data only as a null or an empty slice). A function's
  body checked for an earlier global's initializer, before some global's
  declaration is, cannot ask that global's type, and its check serves the
  calls after the global exists too: every read-back there, of a local
  container as well, gets the inexact null root as a bound for the globals
  (`RootCandidates`), as a global holder's contents are;
* a container that is an exactly rooted local of the function being checked:
  the candidates are the visible locals declared at the container's depth or
  outside it that can hold the pointee, the pointees of reference and slice
  variables in scope with committed roots at that depth, the globals, and
  static data (for a reference to a slice, the slice variables among them
  as §3.5 says: a local once a reference to it has been made, every
  global) -- and the class root of every parameter in scope whose
  pointee, or whose by-value contents, lead through references to storage
  that can hold the pointee (`ReachesThroughRefs`). That storage is the
  caller's, which the body cannot enumerate: a holder parameter is a local,
  but what it holds its argument filled, and whatever the body copies it
  into holds the same. The class root only bounds it (`RootCandidates`
  lists it in `bounds`). But a holder's `contents` are what every store
  into it since it was made put there (`AddContents`): a store through a
  reference to it, at each place an inexact one may name (`ShrinkTargets`),
  and a callee's, a nested function's or a function value's as its call
  maps it (`ApplyCalleeStores`) included. Where each of their roots is a
  variable's own storage exactly, static data, or a view the storage of a
  parameter's class holds (its mark, §3.10 **Class reads**), a value read
  out of the holder where it is checked (`ReadBackLVal`) is one of them
  (`ContentsReadBack`): an exact root stays exact, as it was stored, and
  a marked one is one of the views, as one read out of the storage is. So
  what `words` or `split` made of a local buffer views that buffer alone,
  of a string literal static data alone, and the rules that need identity
  (`index_of`, relative stores, class grouping, BCE's `UltOf`) take a
  reference stored exactly as rooted where it was. A store later in a loop
  body reaches the read on the next iteration, and one of anything else
  there adds a root to the holder's `contents` or takes the mark off one,
  which the loop feeds back (§3.7): its next pass checks the read with that
  store on record. Contents with a root that only bounds what was stored
  (a holder copied out of a slot, whose contents its container bounds)
  take the candidates, and so does a `for` loop binding views read out of
  the holder, whose one read-back, made before the body is checked, stands
  for every iteration's;
* a container reached through a caller's storage, or itself inexact: the
  container's root, inexact, read out of that container (`RootAlt::from`)
  only where the root is the container itself. Where that container is a
  parameter's class named exactly, the storage it stands for -- the
  caller's holder a reference parameter names, the elements of the
  caller's array a slice parameter views -- the value is one of the views
  that storage holds (`RootAlt::classread`, §3.10);
* a container that is a temporary (a literal, a call result or a copy,
  reached without crossing a reference, `LVal::intemp`): nothing in the
  temporary can own what it holds, which came from the literal's
  initializers, the callee's result or the copy's source, so the root is
  the temporary's holder root, exactly as exact (`TempContents`). `for`
  over a temporary and a `match` binder copied out of one take the same
  answer.

Each candidate is an alternative of the value: a variable's own storage
exactly, a parameter's class as a bound, static data as the null root; the
value names one array only with exactly one candidate. Read out of a slot
(the `slotread` of §3.10), an exact candidate whose grow-shrink array could
hold the pointee (`GrowShrinkCanHold`) is left out: rule 3 of §3.5 keeps
every reference rooted there out of slots, whatever else of it could hold
the pointee, so it owns nothing a slot holds. A bound stays, since it
carries the lifetime, and so does the owner of a whole grow-shrink array,
which a slot may refer to. What is left names the array exactly more often --
`index_of`, relative stores and class grouping see it -- and the arguments,
results and bindings the read reaches name no such array: a parameter's
class made from it may be stored, and a caller's shrink pair passes it
(§3.10, parameters' views). Which arrays the
value may point into is settled here, so an array that comes into scope
later at the same depth is not among them. `ReadBackWhy` turns the
alternatives into the "may point into `pool` or `spare`" diagnostic the
rules that need identity produce, naming a bound as "the caller's storage
behind" its parameter. A byte view read back takes the container's
`contents` where they are known.

### 3.7 Reference variables commit to a root

A reference or slice variable is bound at its first non-null binding
(`BindRefProvenance`); before that it reads as `temproot` (`RefRootOf`). A
null-only optional reads as null, with no roots, where every binding that
can come before the read has been checked: anywhere for a local, in the
initializers for a global (`ownerspec` and `CurRealFrame().spec` both null
there), and for a global `let`. A nested function's or a function value's
body reading a local of a frame around it is checked again for a call that
finds the variable otherwise (`envreads`, §3.1), a binding it makes reaches
the loops and cycle rounds around the call (`NoteFact`), and a call reusing
a check made for an earlier pass's or round's incarnation of the variable
binds it as the check did (`ReplayEnvExits`). A global `var` read in a
function's body is `GlobalVarRead` instead (below). `CheckRefRebindRoot`
implements §9.2's rebinding rule: the same roots keep everything (an
inexact new value only weakens exactness); another root at the same depth
joins the variable's alternatives; any other depth is an error. A store
through a reference into a slice variable's slot binds it the same way,
`let` or `var` (§3.5, `StoreIntoSlot`), where the variable is bound
already: one bound to what points nowhere yet is left to the pass or round
that binds it.

**Global `var`s** (`BoundAnywhere`). A function checked after a body reading
a global `var` of reference or slice type may bind it, and the body's check
serves every call (`NoteEnvRead` keys a body by the locals it reads outside
its activation, not by globals), so in a function's body
(`CurRealFrame().spec` set) its reads, `RefProvOf` and `RefRootsOf` alike,
are not its binding but `GlobalVarRead`: `ReadBackRoot` of the global as a
container of itself, read as a slot (§3.6) -- the globals that can own the
pointee, exact where there is one, the pool for an `in pool` one, less the
grow-shrink arrays that could hold the pointee, which the store rule keeps
every binding of a global out of (§3.5, rule 3) -- each alternative a slot
read with `from` the global, which `ReadBackWhy` words as a global any
function may bind. Its `writable` is the binding's, which the global's type
decides (§3.8), and so is its `reusable`, which says how the variable is
represented (`PrefVar`). Its `byteview` is the bindings' so far: a
`const u8` one always has static data among its candidates, so no identity
rule takes it exactly, and the shrink of a global array a later byte view binding
makes it view is judged against the recorded bindings (`NoteGlobalBinding`,
`CheckGlobalShrinks`). A self-relative one only ever holds null and keeps
the variable rules.

**Loops** (`CheckLoopPasses`). A loop body is checked as many times as it
takes for what it feeds back to the loop's head to settle: the roots its
rebinds give the variables declared outside it, the stores into their
contents, the narrowings and assignments its back edges (the end of the
body, every `continue`) drop. Each pass starts from the join of the loop's
entry state with the previous pass's back edges -- the state every
iteration but the first starts in -- so a read earlier in the body than a
rebind sees, on the second pass, every root the rebind gives the variable,
and a shrink earlier in the body than a store sees the store on record
(**Grow-only arrays** below). A fact fed back is noted as it is recorded
(`NoteFact`: `BindProv`, `CheckRefRebindRoot`, and wherever a store adds to
a container's `contents` or takes a class's mark off them, `AddContents`
in `RecordStore` and in a call's replay of what its callee stored,
`ApplyCalleeStores`), against
every enclosing loop the variable is declared outside of (`LoopPass`); a
pass that changed none and read no variable before its binding was checked
against the settled facts, so its errors stood and it was the last. Every
pass before that is *discovery*: a reference variable read before any
binding -- `var last: Node? = null;` before `loop { if last { last.next .=
child; } … last .= child; }` -- points nowhere yet (`RefProvOf` gives it no
roots), which every rule passes by (`FitsAt`, `CheckRootedAtReceiver`,
`BindRefProvenance`, a call's specialization keyed `RootArg::unknown`, the
shrink scans through `UnboundIsBottom`), and the pass after the last one
that changed anything reads such a variable as outside a loop would. A rule
that errs where a value cannot point somewhere -- `free_slice` given a run of
an array the receiver can be none of (§3.14) -- needs every place the value
may point, which a later pass can still add: in a discovery pass it passes the
value by (`VerdictDeferred`), and every loop still discovering then runs the
settled pass that judges it. A
holder declared inside the loop carries only its current pass's store
events (`LiveEventBase`), an earlier pass's being a previous iteration's;
one declared outside carries them all, and a store an earlier pass recorded
is reported as reaching the shrink on the next iteration (`CarriedEvent`).
A pass's warnings are kept back until the loop's last pass, as a
construct's first check of its branches keeps its own (`WarningsHeld`,
§3.4). A callee body checked from inside a pass runs its own loops' passes
(`CheckSpecBody` clears `looppasses`), and a fact it notes about a variable
outside it feeds the loops of the bodies it was called from as well
(`outerbodies`): a nested function or a function value rebinds, and stores
into, the variables of the frames around it. A store of a value rooted at
one of the body's parameters' classes is a fact for its own loops and
rounds alone (`ActivationFloor`): the loops around the call see what the
call maps it to (§3.5).

### 3.8 Writability

`const` is the `cq` bit on the type (§9.5); writability of a *value* is the
`writable` provenance bit. The checker keeps the two consistent at slots:
`constslot` (set by `SlotScope` for fields, elements, annotated variables,
assignment targets and literal initializers; cleared for calls, their
overload resolution included, and returns) makes `FitsAt` reject a
read-only reference or slice landing in a slot whose type is not `const`.
What is read out of a slot is therefore as writable as the slot's type says
(`ContainerRead`), and parameters and results are generic over constness:
`RootArg::writable` is part of the specialization key, so a function given
a literal and the same function given a buffer are two specializations, and
a write through the parameter is an error only in the first.

`const` is shallow, so that holds whatever the path to the slot: the load, a
path crossing the reference there (`DerefLValue`) or stepping into the
slice (`SliceProvenance`), a `for` binding of the element and a field being
rendered (`CheckRenderable`) all take `SlotLoadWritable`'s answer rather
than the path's writability, so `h.r.n = 7` and `inc(h.r.n)` agree for a
`const h` whose `r` is an `S&`. The slot itself stays as writable as the
path: `h.r .= y` is rejected, and `&` of a slice field of `h` is a `const`
reference. A self-relative reference is the exception: it points within the
value or array holding its slot (spec §3.9), so it is no more writable than
the path to the slot, or `inc(c.link.v)` would write a `const c` built with
`link: self`.

`let` prevents whole-binding assignment (`NoLetAssign`, via
`LVal::letbound`) but does not restrict writes to contents. By-value `for`
and `match` bindings are copies; writes to them are rejected by
`NoCopyWrite` using `VarDef::copybind`. A `for` element that is itself a
reference binds as the one it holds either way, loaded and rooted by the
read-back rule where relative; `&x` only makes it a binding that writes
through (`ForLoop::CgStmt` loads it, never the slot's address). A variable's `const` type works the
other way round: a bare name's `LVal::writable` is its *contents'*
writability, which `&x` and the paths into it inherit, while a write of the
variable itself (`=`, a compound assignment, `++`/`--`) is left to those two
rules alone (`WholeWritable`), so a `var s: const u8[:]` re-slices itself.
An un-annotated variable takes that type wherever its initializer is a
read-only reference or slice whose type says nothing (a `u8[:]` result or
parameter read-only in this specialization): `CheckVarDecl`'s `Finish`
adds the `const`, so a later assignment of a read-only value fits, and in
a writable specialization the same declaration stays `u8[:]`.
A field's or an element's `LVal::writable` is the writability of the path
to it, which assigning the slot as a whole takes; the contents of one of a
`const` type other than a slice are read-only however they are reached --
a step into them (`ResolveMemberLValue`, `CheckLValue`'s index), `&x`
(`CheckRefOf`), `x[..]`, or its value bound by reference, passed or grown
(`ContainerRead`) -- as a variable's are.
`&x` of a `const` value is a `const T&`, a slice of read-only storage is a
`const T[:]`, a string literal is `const u8[:]`, a `bytes_of` view is never
writable, and `null` and the `default<T>()` of a reference or slice count
as writable so they fit any slot.

A reference to a slice names the slot holding it, and what is loaded
through it -- its pointee (`DecayRef`), a path crossing it, a builtin's
receiver, a `for` over it, a slice argument -- is that slot's slice
(`SlotView`), as writable as the reference, the binding of a slice variable
or of the one standing for a view's slice (`VarDef::heldslice`, keyed with
the view, §3.4) and the slice's type allow. Behind a parameter's class
without a view, an inexact root or a read-back only the reference is left to
say, so a writable reference is only ever made to a slot whose slice is
writable or of a `const` type: `&x` of a slice variable is no more writable
than its binding (`CheckRefOf`), as binding the variable by reference is
(`AutoRef`), and a field's or an element's slice is writable unless the
slot's type says `const`. What a store through the reference writes is the
slot, so the reference is no more writable than `&` of the slot either: a
slice lvalue bound by reference (`SlotRoots`, for `AutoRef`, `FitsAt` and
`RefSliceArgs`) is the reference `&x` of it makes (`Val::slot`), read-only
through a by-value binder, a `const` value, a `const T&` or a call's result,
and a variable's no more writable than its binding. A slice of a `const`
type stays read-only through a writable reference, so one of those may
re-point a field of that type.

Any other pointee loaded through a reference (`DecayRef`) lies where the
reference points and is as writable as the reference, as a path crossing
it is (`DerefLValue`): a `format` overload taking it by reference is
handed it there (**Format overloads**), and a slice a construct joins an
array behind the reference into views it there (`JoinBranches`, spec
§6.4). A varint's is read-only, since it loads as the `i64` it decodes to,
which an overload taking an `i64&` would otherwise write (spec §3.6).

### 3.9 Flow state: definite assignment and narrowing

Each `VarDef` carries `assigned`, `maybeassigned` and `narrowed` (the `T&`
type an optional is narrowed to). `SaveFlow`/`RestoreFlow`/`MergeFlow`
snapshot and join them at every branch, for the variables the code between
can name -- those of the current frame, of the frames it is lexically nested
in, and of the frames the function values it can call were written in
(`NamedFrames`), and the globals -- since no other frame's can change
meanwhile: a fact holds after a join iff it holds in every reachable branch,
and a variable is maybe assigned iff it is in some reachable one, with
`reachable` tracking divergence (`return`, `break`, `continue`, `abort`,
`exit`). A local snapshot entry keeps its index, variable identity and facts
together; restoring or joining it never transfers a departed local's facts
to a later variable at the same index. `JoinFlow` computes a snapshot over
the currently nameable variables without mutating their live state;
`MergeFlow` installs that result. A loop or `block` is left in the join of
the states at its exits:
each reachable `break` out of it joins its state into the construct's scope
(`NoteBreak`, `Scope::breakflow`), and `JoinBreakFlow` joins that with the
construct's own exit -- the end of a block's body, a `while`'s condition
found false, a `for`'s head once its iterations run out -- or, for a
`loop`, which has none, takes it alone. A callee's check leaves the ones it
can name narrowed as it found them, assigned where all of its exits agree
and maybe assigned where any may be (`CheckSpecBodyOnce`, `BodyExits`,
`NoteExit`), not as the end of its text does: each `return`, the tail and a
reachable end. Those it found assigned stay as they were: where its text
ends no path may reach, as after an `if` whose branches both return, every
variable holds every fact and may be assigned on no path. A function
value's `return`, or a `return from` in a callee, exits the body it names
(`Frame::exits`), and every body checked in the frames between records what
its activation had assigned by then, and what it may have assigned since it
began (`FnSpec::outerexits`), which a call reusing it takes again
(`ReplayOuterExits`). A body with no exit its caller reaches leaves them as
its end did: the code after the call never runs. A branch that diverges has
the null "bottom" type, which unifies with anything (`UnifyBranch`,
`MergeVals`), and reads as `void` once the construct's node is left
(`VoidIfBottom`). An `if` that ends its block, as the one a guard parses
to does, and whose `else` diverges is marked `IfExpr::flat` (`CheckIf`,
by `blockpos`): codegen puts its then-block after the `else` in the C
block the `if` is in (§6.2), and the inliner counts no block for it (§4).

A `let` declared without an initializer is assigned, or bound with `.=`,
only where it is not maybe assigned (`NoLetReassign`, §4.4), which is
judged once the value is checked, since computing it may assign the `let`
too. Every assignment and binding sets the bit. A `&&`'s or `||`'s right
operand may run, so what it assigns is maybe assigned after the condition.
A loop's head joins its back edges (§3.7), so a `let` declared outside the
loop and assigned in it is maybe assigned in the next pass, where the
assignment errs. A nested function's key holds the bit for a `let` only
(`EnvIs`), whose check reads it; a call reusing the body leaves a `var`
maybe assigned where it was or where the check left it (`ReplayEnvExits`).

`NarrowCond` narrows on `if`/`while`/`assert` conditions, through
`!`, `&&` and `||` (a `&&`'s right operand may not run, so what it
un-narrows is recorded as `Binary::rightkills`), and `== null`/`!= null`.
Loops: a rebind in the body (a `.=`, a callee's `reboundoptionals`) drops
the narrowing from that point on, and the join of the loop's back edges
with its entry (`CheckLoopPasses`, §3.7) is what the body is checked in
again, so a use that relied on the narrowing errors there; a `while`
condition runs before every iteration, and its own narrowings hold in the
body each time. A callee's rebinds of the caller's optionals reach the
caller through `ApplyCalleeRebinds`, for a callee still being checked from
the record of its cycle's previous round (§3.11), none in the first.

### 3.10 The shrink rules, and growth and uses during construction

**Grow-only arrays** (§5.1). `pop`, `resize` and `clear` on a `[>..]`
(`CheckBuiltin` → `CheckGrowShrink` → `GrowOnlyShrinkAt`,
`typecheck_builtins.h`), and whole assignment of one or of a value holding
one (`CheckAssign`, `ResizableArrayIn`), pass in this order:

1. the receiver names the array's variable, or a reference variable or
   parameter whose root is known (the array behind it shrinks); not an
   element of another value, and not in a global initializer;
2. not a `reusable` pool;
3. no operand evaluated earlier in this statement and still held may refer
   into it (`CheckHeldShrinks` over `HeldOperands`, §3.3), nor, where it is
   a reference to a slice or to a holder, or a slice of slices or of
   holders, may what it holds; an assignment's location counts as the slot
   alone, since the assignment overwrites what the slot holds, and so does a
   slot a `for` loop reads again, whose sequence is held itself. The shrink
   may be anywhere in its statement: the node path holds whatever the
   enclosing expressions evaluated before it, inside the value of an `if`,
   `match`, block or loop as well, and a function value's body is checked
   on the path of the statement calling it (`CheckFunValCall`), whose own
   caller applies the shrink against its statement from the summary;
4. no variable in scope may refer into it: a reference or slice variable
   whose pointee the array's elements can contain (or a byte
   view), rooted at it -- or a `var` at the same depth, or an inexact root
   at or below its depth, or a not-yet-bound variable declared at or below
   it -- **and used afterwards**; a holder variable into which a store of a
   reference into the array is on record (`HolderMayPointInto`, following
   holder copies through their source containers and judging a global source
   by its type), or a store of a reference to a slot that may hold one
   (`StoredSlotMayPointInto`), and used afterwards; a reference to a holder
   whose store record says the same, or to a slice slot that may hold a
   slice into it, and a slice whose elements, slices or holders, may hold
   one (`HeldRefsMayPointInto`), and used afterwards. Of such a slot, a
   local holder named exactly holds what its record says (behind a
   reference or slice variable, one that is no `var`), an array's elements
   a slice views among them; a parameter's class named so -- the caller's
   holder a reference parameter names, the caller's array a slice
   parameter views the elements of, whether a variable or a holder's
   stored reference or slice names it, a by-value holder parameter's
   contents among them where they are that one array (`RootArg::heldexact`,
   §3.4) -- holds what the activation's own stores into it put there, the
   rest being its callers' to judge (**Parameters' views** below), and a
   view read out of that storage, in an operand still held (item 3) or a
   variable that is no `var`, points where the storage's views do, judged
   the same way, as does a holder of the activation's keeping one or
   copied out of that storage alone (**Class reads** below); a class a
   holder's stored reference to a slice names is a slot that may be a slice
   variable, whose binding no store record describes
   (`StoreEvent::sliceref`, `RefSlots`),
   so it holds whatever is at its depth or outside it, as below; and behind
   a reference variable a parameter's class with a class of its own for the
   slice its slot holds what the binding of the variable standing for that
   slice says (§3.4),
   and, as for a slice of such values, what that slice's elements hold;
   any other slot holds whatever is at its depth or outside it, but a
   global one a holder refers to, or a global holder a reference or slice
   leads to, which item 5 judges. A slot's references may lead into the
   array at any remove, so both count every type they reach
   (`ReachedThroughRefs`). The variables are the body's and its lexical
   parents', and in a function value's body those of the function running
   it too (`ShrinkScanVars`); every caller's are judged at its call
   instead, the first caller's too (**Calls** below), where the rest of its
   statement is in view;
5. for a global receiver, the other globals are judged once every function
   has been checked (`NoteGlobalShrink` keeps the first shrink of each
   array, with its instantiation chain, for `CheckGlobalShrinks`): a global
   the record leaves able to hold a reference into the array fails the
   shrink, the error naming the store. The record followed is the stores as
   made (`madestores`, which a call's mapping of its callee's events in
   place, for the first call only, leaves alone) and the bindings of global
   references and slices (`NoteGlobalBinding`, beside `VarDef::ref`);
   through the containers a copy came out of (`src`, `from`); and through
   the calls that passed a parameter's class (`classuses`, which
   `NoteClassUses` fills at every call, back edges included), a class
   standing for every argument its calls gave it. A root that bounds the
   storage and names no container it was read out of -- static data a back
   edge returns included, which `RetAltVal` makes inexact -- may be any array
   its pointee fits. A store through a reference into a global slice
   variable's slot is both an event on it and its binding (§3.5);
6. the shrink is recorded for the callers (`NoteShrink`: `shrinkexternals`
   for globals and captured locals, `shrinkparams` for parameters), and so
   are the views still used that only the callers can tell apart from the
   array (`NoteLiveViews`, **Parameters' views** below), and it is logged
   for the values under construction around it (`NoteShrinkEvent`,
   **Growth during construction** below).

Inside a loop, a store later in the body than the shrink, a callee's
included, is on record when the body is checked again (`CheckLoopPasses`,
§3.7), so item 4 finds it, and names it as reaching the shrink on the next
iteration (`CarriedEvent`).

**`for` loops** (§6.5). A `for` around the shrink holds what it walks while
its body is checked (`HoldForSequence`, §3.3): item 4, and the grow-shrink
scan below, meet its sequence and the references and slices on the path to
it as held operands, whatever statement of the body the shrink is in, and
name the loop (`Held::loop`); a callee's shrinks meet them at the call
through its summary, a function value's at the call that runs it, and the
pairs `NoteLiveViews` keeps carry them to the callers. A sequence whose
elements hold references leads to what those point into, whatever the
loop's binding copies out of it. A resizable array iterated itself is not
held: the loop reads its length again on every iteration, and its elements
never move.

**Liveness** (`UsedAfter`) is syntactic: the variable's name occurs in a
later statement of an open block at or inside its scope, in that block's
tail, anywhere in an enclosing loop it was declared outside of, or in a part
of its own statement not yet evaluated (`LaterOperands`, §3.3): a whole
assignment's right-hand side, a call's later arguments, a literal's later
fields, the arguments print, str and format render after the one being
checked (**Format overloads** below), and, where the shrink is in the head
of a construct on the path -- an `if`'s condition, a `match`'s scrutinee, a
`for`'s sequence -- the parts that head leads to (`AfterHead`;
an else-if is on the path of its own for this); a `for` binding is always
live; `MentionsName` follows calls of nested functions by name into their
bodies. The body of a function value being checked (an `isfunval` frame's
own block) counts whole for a variable declared outside it, since the
function running it may call it again. Only what is checked in the
variable's own frame or in one lexically nested in it counts (`NamesFrame`
over `lexframe`: a nested function's body, a function value's written
there): a path entry records the frame checking it (`PathEntry::frame`), a
block or a loop is in its scope's (`FrameOfScope`), and the same name in
any other frame -- the function running a function value's body, a callee
checked inside its first caller's check -- is another variable, whose own
frame judges it. The test never depends on what the optimizer proves.

**Grow-shrink arrays** (§5.2): `ShrinkGrowShrink` runs from anywhere (a
local, a reference, a global, a struct's tail, whole assignment) and scans
held temporaries and the reference and slice variables in scope only
(`CheckShrinkHolders`), inside a function value's body those of the function
running it included (`ShrinkScanVars`): references into such an array can
never be stored (§3.5 rule 3), so checking those variables and temporaries
is sufficient.
That includes a reference to a slice variable, whose slice may view the
array: the variable's own binding says where, as the variable standing for
the slice a parameter's slot holds does where it has one (§3.4), and any
other parameter's class, which stands for a slot of the caller's, only
bounds it.

**Slot reads** (`RootAlt::slotread`). For the same reason, a plain reference
or slice loaded out of a field or an element (`ReadBackLVal`, where
`LVal::isslot` says the location is one, not the pointee of a reference), a
global reference or slice variable (`RefProvOf`; rule 3 covers a global's
own bindings) and a `for` binder copying views out of an array (`CheckFor`)
never point into a grow-shrink array's elements: their read-back leaves out
the storage that could own them there (§3.6), though what still bounds them
may hold such an array. A slice of such a slice, and a reference into what
it views, keep the bit; `MergeVals`, a rebind (`CheckRefRebindRoot`) and a
call's result (every root its returns give, never a back edge's) keep it
only where every value does; and crossing a reference drops it
(`DerefLValue`, `DecayRef`, `Dot::Check`'s auto-deref, a `for` loop or a
builtin member through a reference, a whole array meeting a slice
destination through one), since what a reference read
out of a field leads to may be a whole grow-shrink array, or a variable
holding a view into one. A slice loaded through a reference to a slice
variable has what the variable's binding has (`SlotView`), and one a
container holds, loaded through a reference to its field or element, is a
slot read of its own. A relative reference never has
it: it points within the array that holds it. A holder has it on its
contents where it was read out of a field or an element (`ContainerRead`),
copied out of one by a `for` or `match` binder, popped, or copied out of a
slice by `append` (`AppendedCopies`): every reference it holds was stored
there, while the container still bounds them. A variable bound to it, a
literal or a merge holding it (`RecordStore`, `NoteLitElem`, `MergeVals`),
and a call's result where every return's contents have it (`RecordReturn`,
`CallResult`, never at a back edge) keep it, and a parameter keeps it
through the key (§3.4); a holder loaded through a reference (`DecayRef`)
does not have it. The store rule passes over it (`GrowShrinkTaint`, and for
a holder's contents `StoredIntoGrowShrink`, §3.5 rule 3), so a variable
bound to it points into no grow-shrink array and may not be rebound into
one, and a holder having it is stored wherever its contents' roots outlive
the destination. The §5.2 scans pass over
a held temporary that has it, and over a variable that has it unless a
binding its record does not show could
put a view of the array there (`SlotReadMayRetarget`): one not bound yet, a
`var` rooted at the array's depth, and, inside a loop the `var` was declared
outside of, one rooted at that depth or deeper, which a rebind later in the
body may have left a branch's inexactly rooted value in. Neither exemption
reaches what a reference to a slice leads to (`HeldRefsMayPointInto`). The
§5.1 scans never use it: views of a grow-only array, byte views included,
are stored like any others.

**Class reads** (`RootAlt::classread`). A reference or slice read out of
the storage a parameter's class stands for, the class named exactly (§3.6)
-- an element of the caller's array a slice parameter views, a field of the
caller's holder a reference parameter names, a `for` binder copying either
-- is one of the views that storage holds, never a reference into it: it
points where the storage's views do, which is what the activation stored
there and what its callers did. A slice of such a view, and a reference into
what it views, keep the mark; `MergeVals`, a rebind and a call's result keep
it only where every value does (`Roots::Add`), so a value that may also be
the storage's own element -- a reference to one of its elements merged with
a reference read out of one, which is one alternative for the class, as
inexact as the read and read out of neither (`RootAlt::from`) -- is judged
by depth as before; a bound (`Weaken`, `Bounds`), crossing a reference and a
back edge's result (`ClearReads`) drop it. A call's result has it where the
callee read the view out of its parameter's storage and the argument names a
class of the caller exactly (`RetAltVal`). For a grow-only array, the scans
judge such a view, in an operand still held or a variable that is no `var`,
and what it leads to, by the activation's stores into the storage
(`ClassReadMayPointInto`: `HolderMayPointInto` on the class), and
`NoteLiveViews` keeps the pair about what the storage holds for the callers
(`HeldViews`, `LiveShrink::contents`) -- even where the class is the array
shrunk, whose elements the caller may have made the storage's references
point into. At a call such a pair keeps the mark where the argument has it,
handing the question to the caller's callers, and a callee's view into what
an argument with the mark views (`show(out, w)`, `w` read out of `words`)
becomes a pair about what that storage holds, of a type leading to what the
view points at (`MapLiveShrinks`). The §5.2 scans do not use it: such a view
is a slot read, which they pass over.

A store of such a view into a holder (`H { s: words[0] }`, `h.s = r.s`), and
a holder copied out of that storage alone -- a `for` or `match` binder's
copy, `hs[0]`, `pop`, `append` or `copy` of one, the holder a reference
parameter names loaded by value, wherever the source is the class exactly
(`HolderSource`) -- is marked on the store record (`StoreEvent::classread`,
in `RecordStore`): what the holder got there, the storage holds. A call
keeps the mark where the class the event names maps onto a class of the
caller's exactly (`ApplyCalleeStores`). For a grow-only array, the scans
judge such an event by the activation's stores into the storage
(`HolderMayPointInto` on the class, as for a copy of a variable's contents),
and a slice's slot what came out of there refers to by the class's depth, as
for a slot the class names itself (`StoredSlotMayPointInto`); `NoteLiveViews`
keeps the pair about what the storage holds for the callers, of the holder's
type, whose references lead where what came out of there does
(`EachHolderRoot`, `RecordedViews`).

A copy's contents carry the mark where it lies in that storage alone
(`MarkClassCopy`: `hs[0]`, `pop`, the holder a reference parameter names
loaded by value), so a merge of copies (`if c { hs[0] } else { hs[1] }`), a
literal holding one (`Q { h: hs[0] }`) and a call's result that is one
(`first(hs)` for `fn first(hs: H[:]) -> H { return hs[0]; }`, `RetAltVal`)
hold views of the storage too, and storing any of them is marked as above.
Each keeps the mark at a class only where every value it joins there has it
(`Roots::Add`, `RecordReturn`): beside a reference into the storage itself
(`Q { h: ns[1], at: ns[0] }`), or a node loaded through a view read out of
it, what it holds there is judged by depth as before. A variable's contents
keep the mark at a class where every store of it there put such views
(`AddContents`: a copy, a `for` or `match` binder's included, a view read
out of the storage, a value holding either, and a callee's such store as
its call maps it), so a merge or a literal holding the variable, a copy of
it, and a value read out of it (`let n = ns[1]; let nx = n.next;`, §3.6,
`ContentsReadBack`) hold views of the storage too. A store of anything
else there takes the mark away (`Roots::Add`), which a loop around it
feeds back as it does a new root (§3.7): a read earlier in the body is
checked again with the store on record.

**Inexact receivers.** Both scans run once per array the shrink may free
(`ShrinkThrough` over `ShrinkTargets`), one per alternative of the receiver's
roots. An exact alternative is the array. An inexact one -- a container
reached through a parameter (§3.6), a back edge's unknown result -- only
bounds it, so the array may be any one of its type owned at the root's
depth or outside it:
every candidate `RootCandidates` finds for that type at the root's depth
(locals, pointees of references in scope, parameter classes, globals, and
the bounds standing for the caller's storage a parameter's references lead
to). The root itself is scanned first, and where it is such a bound, or its
own storage cannot hold the array (a holder it was read out of), the scans
filter pointees by the array's type rather than the root's, and
`NoteShrink` records it as `shrinkparambounds` or `shrinkexternalbounds`
with that type. Diagnostics name the other arrays as the receiver may point
at them.

**Calls** (`ApplyCalleeShrinks`): for a checked callee, each `shrinkparams`
entry becomes a shrink of the argument's root at the call, of every array
it bounds where it is inexact -- for a by-value holder parameter, of the
array its references point into (§3.4), exactly, since only a class that is
one array exactly records such an entry -- and each `shrinkexternals` entry
a shrink of that variable; each bound entry becomes a shrink of every array
of its type that the argument's root (a holder's contents' root) or the
external bounds. The parameter's pointee decides the scan, or for a holder
the array's own type: §5.1 where the array freed is grow-only (a struct's
tail included, `GrowOnlyTail`), §5.2 otherwise. For a callee still being
checked, the record read is the one its cycle's previous round made
(`RecordOf`, §3.11), and none in the first round: a back edge then shrinks
nothing, and the round after applies what the first recorded.

**Parameters' views** (`FnRecord::liveshrinks`). The scans see the
activation's variables only, and take a parameter's class for an array of
its own: never a global or captured array a caller passed a view of, nor
what another class names, which the arguments for the two may make one array
(an inexactly rooted argument gets a class of its own, §3.4, and a caller may
pass its own classes on). So after the scans `NoteLiveViews` looks again at
what is still used -- a reference or slice variable (`UsedAfter`, which
counts the rest of the statement, `LaterOperands`; inside a function value's
body, one of the function running it too, `ShrinkScanVars`, whose parameters'
pairs are its own record's), an operand still held
(`HeldOperands`), a grow-only holder by its store record
(`EachHolderRoot`; what came out of a class's storage alone as what that
storage holds, **Class reads** above), followed, as the scan follows it,
through a stored reference to a slot holding references to what that
slot holds
(`StoredViews`), and what a reference to a slice or, for a grow-only
array, to a holder, or a slice of holders or of slices, reaches
(`HeldViews`): for a holder named exactly by a value that is no `var`,
what its store record says, as for the holder itself, for a parameter's
class named so, what the activation's own stores into it say and what its
callers put there (a view of its own, `LiveShrink::contents`), as for a
view read out of such storage (**Class reads** above), for any other but a
global one, a class a holder's stored reference to a slice names included,
whatever its root bounds -- for a view only the callers can tell apart from
the array (`CallersJudge`): its root is a parameter's class, or the array
is, and what a class's storage holds whichever array shrinks. For a
grow-shrink array a slot read is none, the scans passing over it (**Slot
reads** above), though what a reference to a slice leads to may be.
`NoteLiveShrink` keeps such a pair (a `LiveShrink`) on the
specialization when `MayAliasRoots` does not rule it out and both roots are
classes or storage outside the activation (globals, a lexical parent's
variables and classes), with the array's type where the shrunk root only
bounds it (`LiveShrink::bound`), and it keeps one about what a class's
storage holds (`LiveShrink::contents`) wherever the array is outside the
activation, since what the callers stored there outlives that storage; a
store a loop body's later iteration brings to the shrink is on record when
the body is checked again (§3.7). At a call, `ApplyCalleeLiveShrinks` maps
each pair's classes onto the roots of the arguments passed for them
(`ClassArgRoot`): two roots the caller can tell apart pass, one root or two
it cannot tell apart are an error at the call, which names the array as the
caller does, and a pair still open for the caller -- one of its roots is the
caller's class -- is kept on the caller's record in turn, under that
parameter's name. A pair about what a class's storage holds becomes the
views what the storage the argument names holds leads to, as the caller
sees them (`HeldViews`), each judged as a pair is: a holder or array of the
caller's or of a parent's by its store record, where what the callee
stored into it is on record by then (`ApplyCalleeStores`); a temporary,
which the callee cannot write, by what made it (`TempContents`), and one
nothing records, a slice of a call's result, as holding anything; a class
of the caller's, or a view one's storage held, by the caller's own stores
into that storage, and as such a pair in turn; a global by the judgement of
the globals (item 5); anything else by its root, as a bound. A callee in a
recursive cycle still being checked has the pairs its cycle's previous
round recorded, which the call maps (§3.11), and none in the first round.
A class the callee shrank, mapped onto an argument
whose root only bounds it, may be any array of the shrink's kind in what
that root leads to (`BoundReach`), as well as the root's own.

**Balanced calls** (§5.2). Each summary entry carries a `ShrinkBalance`,
the worst of the shrinks `NoteShrink` recorded against it: balanced or
not. A grow-shrink `resize` is balanced where
`ResizesToMark` holds: its length argument names a `let` of the activation
(`ownerspec` is the current real frame's specialization, so a mark a nested
function or a block's writer took before this activation began does not
count) whose initializer was exactly `X.len` (`VarDef::markof`, set by
`CheckVarDecl`), and `SamePath` finds that `X` and the receiver name the
same storage: the same variable, not a `var` reference, then the same
fields, none of them read out as a reference or slice. A writable
reference can still change the `let` (§4.4), so a mark with `refwrite`
(`NoteWritableRef`, §3.14) is none, and one a balanced resize accepted is
marked relied on (`markuse`), which makes a writable reference noted later
an error: the resize's balance is recorded by then, and a loop checked in
one pass, or a nested function checked once, can run the write before the
resize's next run, which nothing judges again. No other shrink in a
body is balanced: `pop`, `clear`, other resizes, whole assignment, and a
grow-only array's shrinks (`GrowOnlyShrinkAt` records every shrink
unbalanced). The body's own scans are unchanged, a balanced resize
included, and so are the pairs `NoteLiveViews` keeps for it. At a call to a
checked callee, `ApplyCalleeShrinks` first expands every entry into the
arrays it may shrink (`ShrinkTargets`), each with its entry's balance, then
judges them together: a grow-shrink array whose shrinks are all balanced,
and that no unbalanced one may be (`MayAliasRoots`, a bound taken as inexact
and two classes of one activation as one array), is recorded as a balanced
shrink without the §5.2 scan, and without pairs for the callers, since a
view rooted at a class was taken before the call too; every other array is
scanned and recorded unbalanced as before. The skipped scan includes what a
reference to a slice variable reaches (`HeldRefsMayPointInto`): the
variable still holds a slice taken before the call, since writing a view of
the array into it through a reference is a store (§3.5 rule 3).

A back edge applies the balances its cycle's previous round recorded for
its callee (§3.11), none in the first round; the round after the last that
changed a record judges every call with the settled balances.

**Format overloads** (§3.7). print, str and format check their arguments in
order (`CheckPrintable`): each one's value, then its rendering
(`CheckRenderable`), which specializes the user `format` overload of each
type it meets with that part's roots and permissions, and the builder --
the format call's receiver where the text lands in it, else a temporary --
and applies it as a call there (`UserFormatIn`: `ApplyCalleeShrinks`,
`ApplyCalleeRebinds`, `ApplyCalleeGrows`, and `NoteWritableRef` for a
variable taken whole by a writable reference). Codegen evaluates each argument
just before rendering it (`EmitFormatInto`, `EmitStr`), so while argument i
is checked the ones after it are later operands (`LaterOperands`): a shrink
in its evaluation (a call) or its rendering (an overload) finds a variable
they name used after it. The rest of the argument is rendered around its
overloads, and is held while they are applied (`renderarg`, the one
operand of print, str or format `HeldOperands` holds, with `Held::render`
naming the builtin for the error): the views held for any argument (an
optional reference or a slice, a non-fixed array's elements, a holder's
references), and, for a struct, enum or array argument no overload takes
whole (`renderwhere`), a reference to where it lies, which may be an element
of the array an overload clears (a plain reference argument has decayed to
its pointee, which lies where the reference points). So are the parts
`CheckRenderable` is walking in place where it meets the overload
(`renderwalks`): a variable-mode ADT, whose tag codegen reads once, and an
array of a size not fixed, whose count it does, each as a reference to
where it lies (`Held::inplace`). Such a reference is not the path to a
resizable a reference to one otherwise is: a shrink of the storage it lies
in, of either kind, may free its elements or rebuild it, as a whole
assignment rebuilds every variable-size part of the value it assigns
(`ShrinkMayMove`), and a slot may hold the path it was reached through.
`NoteLiveViews` sees them all, so a function rendering its parameter
around an overload, or after one, keeps the pair for its callers
(**Parameters' views** above; `LiveShrink::inplace`). A callee
body checked meanwhile starts with an empty path (`CheckSpecBody`): the
call site applies its summary against the caller's statement. An overload
taking a value by reference is given where it lies, as writable as the
path to it: a reference argument's pointee lies where the reference
points, its fields and elements with it, as writable as the reference
(`DecayRef`, §3.8), and what the overload stores there is judged against
that storage. That pointee is storage whatever roots the reference has
(`Val::pointee`). An argument that is no storage lies in the temporary
codegen renders it from (`GenLoc`), and so do its parts: a call's result,
a struct or array literal and a control construct's value are rooted at
one already; any other has no roots (an operator's result, a scalar
literal, a cast, a variant constant, a `.len`, a literal parameter), which
every rule would take for static data outliving whatever an overload
stores a reference into, and is rooted at a fresh one (`CheckPrintable`).
An overload
taking a slice by reference is given the slice's slot, which codegen passes
(`EmitUserFormat`), bound as `RefSliceArgs` binds a slice lvalue
(`SlotRoots`, `NoteHeld`). Every slice rendered has one (`Val::slot`): the
variable, field or element it was read from, where a reference argument
points (`DecayRef`), a reference a call returns included, which codegen
holds and renders the pointee of (`RenderedLoc`), the part a nested one
lies in (a field's struct, an element's array or slice, a reference's
pointee), as writable as that is, and for a value that is no storage a
temporary (`CheckPrintable`): the value a call returns, and the value of a
control construct or of a function value's call,
a copy of what its branch gives even where that names a variable (§4.1),
which keeps none of that branch's slot (`TempCopy`); a reference parameter
binds the branch itself instead (§3.12). What the overload stores there
rebinds the caller's variable or is recorded in its container
(`ApplyCalleeStores`), and it re-points no slot `&` could not write. The
temporary is read-only (§9.5), and codegen passes one wherever the
optimizer reduces the argument to the storage it was copied from
(`OptRendered`, **Views of copies**). The parts of a fixed-mode ADT's
payload lie in a temporary too, the copy codegen renders them from
(§3.15): `CheckRenderable` takes them out of a `TempCopy` of the ADT, whose
contents are the ADT's, so an overload given one by reference can neither
keep it nor write it, as nothing may refer into the payload itself (§3.5).
No fixed-mode payload holds self-relative references (`ValidateType`), so
the copy keeps every link. An overload taking a value holding them by value
(`UserFormatIn`), which `EmitUserFormat` would copy, is rejected.
A type that reaches itself through references renders every level below
the first by a function of its own that runs no overload (§6.9), so
`CheckRenderable` stops at a type already on its path, noting it, and once
the argument's overloads are known `CheckPrintable` rejects it if one of
them renders a part of such a type at any depth (`OverloadedPart`),
telling the program to give the type an overload of its own. Every level
is then read as the first is, and a payload's parts lead to no overload
through one, which leaves the payload rule above complete.

**Growth during construction** (§1.3(4), §4.2). A value built in place at an
array's top or slot is under construction while its expression is checked,
and nothing may grow or shrink that array meanwhile: a pushed or pool-allocated
element that is variable-size or holds relative references of either form
(`BuiltInPlace`: `EmitPush` builds such an element in its slot, and
`EmitAlloc` a literal of one; any other fixed-size element is evaluated
before its slot is claimed, §6.5), a call's array result being appended
to a non-limited array (a `T[..]` result too, though `EmitAppend` builds it
on a temporary, §6.5), an appended literal of elements that are
variable-size or hold relative references of either form (which
`EmitAppend` builds in place), and the new contents of a whole
assignment of a resizable
(`CheckAssign`, `PointeeAssign`). Every growth is logged (`NoteGrow` →
`growlog`): `push`, `append`, `alloc_index`/`alloc_ref`, `format`,
`resize`, `to_bytes(a, out)`, whole assignment, and what a callee grows
(`ApplyCalleeGrows`: `growparams` mapped onto the roots their classes stand
for, §3.4, `growexternals` for globals and captured locals, recorded per
specialization by `NoteRootEvent` exactly as shrinks are; a callee still
being checked contributes what its text grows, `SyntacticGrows`, the shrink
scanner with the growth operations; a C function is taken to append to
every builder it is handed). So is every shrink, of either kind of array, as
a `GrowEvent` with `shrink` set (`NoteShrinkEvent`: per target in
`ShrinkThrough` for a builtin's or a whole assignment's, and in
`ApplyCalleeShrinks` for a callee's, a balanced one included, since even a
resize back to a mark drops the top onto the value). When the constructed
expression's check ends, the growths and shrinks logged meanwhile are judged
against the constructed root (`CheckGrowsSince`, `MayAliasRoots`): the same
root conflicts; two variables are distinct unless one is inexact and at or
below the other's depth (as in the held-temporary scan); a parameter class
is distinct from a variable of the activation named exactly, may be a global
or a captured local, and two classes of one activation are settled once
every call site has been seen (`growconflicts`, `ResolveGrowConflicts`):
distinct only where both are concrete and exact (§3.4). The log is per
activation (`CheckSpecBody` saves and clears it), so a callee's growths and
shrinks reach the caller's constructions only through the summary.

**Uses during a whole assignment** (§4.4). The new contents are built over
the old ones, so once the right-hand side is checked, `CheckBuiltUses`
walks it for anything that may use the array: an identifier naming the
array's variable (or the value holding it), or a reference to either
(`ReachesBuilt`: `CanContain` of the array type, then `MayAliasRoots` as for
growth, `AL_DEFER` going to `growconflicts`); and for each call, each
specialization it may run (`spec`, `dispatch`, `fmtspecs`), what that
callee's body and its callees' name outside their own activations
(`NamedOutside`, walking the checked bodies with `RunChildren`, so function
value bodies are included): globals and variables of lexical parents. A
callee still being checked counts as naming every global and every variable
in `vars`. A rebind's target (`r .= …`) is not a use, and a field path
from the lvalue's own variable that parts from the lvalue's path at a flat
field is not one either (`FieldsApart`): `t.chars = f(t.font)`. Slices and
element references are left to the shrink scan, which sees the right-hand
side as after the shrink. A reference parameter's class may be a global or
captured array, so using one while building such an array is an error in
the body, as a growth of one would be.

### 3.11 Recursion

A call that reaches a specialization already `inprogress` is a back edge.
`ValidateCycle` requires the reused specialization's function to be
`recursive` and fully typed parameters from it inward, commits an unknown
return type to "returns nothing", and joins the cycle (`JoinCycle`): every
frame from the cycle's outermost member on the call path (`CycleHead`,
following `FnSpec::cyclelink`) inward is inside a call into the cycle, so
it is marked `incycle` and its cycle linked under that member, and a
variable of non-fixed class in scope in any of those frames is an error at
that frame's call, since every activation would keep it on a data stack of
its own (§7.8). A by-value non-fixed parameter is always in scope there. A
local whose own initializer calls into the cycle holds its stack across the
call too, being built in place: each frame counts the calls into a cycle it
has been inside, and `CheckCycleInit` compares the count across the
initializer once the local's type is known. A call reusing a finished
specialization whose cycle's outermost member is still in progress leads
back into that cycle as well and joins it the same way, so a later call to
a cycle member, or a function that reaches the cycle only through one, is
checked like a back edge; the explicit-type rule stays with back edges,
where inference would cross the cycle. A function marked this way was in the
cycle from its first statement, so what its body stored before is inside the
cycle too: the cycle's next round checks the body again with the mark set
(**Rounds** below), and the error names the call that joined it
(`FnSpec::joinedat`). `ValidatePoolArgs`
requires every pool-class and pool-named parameter to be passed the same
ultimate root the entry call passed (`UltimateRoot` follows `classfrom`
chains). The cycle store rule is §3.5 rule 4; the optimizer never inlines
into a cycle member.

**Threaded parameters.** A parameter class other than a pool, all of whose
members its creating call rooted exactly as references or slices, is
threaded (`ThreadedClass`, noted by `NoteThreadedClass`) until a call into
its cycle passes one of its parameters something other than a root exactly
at the same ultimate root, reached through classes that are pools or
threaded themselves (`ValidateThreadArgs`, `ThreadedChain`): in every
activation it then points where its creating call's argument did. Back
edges are checked, and so are calls reaching a finished member of a cycle
still being checked: its body's calls back into the cycle were checked with
what it was first given, and pass on whatever the call gives it. A class
created from another class's parameter, or given one at such a call, is
threaded only while that one is: it is recorded among that class's heirs,
which break with it, and one created from a broken class is born broken,
since each activation of the creating function makes the call anew with
what it was given. A reference rooted at a threaded class whose ultimate
root lies outside every cycle -- a global, or a variable of a function
neither recursive nor in a cycle, as for a free variable -- may be stored
inside the cycle (`ThreadStorable`), where every storage the destination
may be (`ShrinkTargets`) is a variable, a pool, or a threaded class too,
since the store lands where that class points, or leads, in each activation.
Nothing makes a back edge pass a class on, so it is restricted only once a
store needs it: a call that breaks it (`Unthread`, naming the call and the
parameter in `ThreadedClass::why`) makes every store relying on it an error
at the store (`CycleStoreError`), the ones checked before the call by the
cycle's next round, which finds the class broken (**Rounds** below). A
merged value or rebound variable that may be rooted at a threaded class
relies on it like any other, every one of its roots having to be storable.

A recursion whose types never repeat has no back edge: each round is a new
specialization, checked inside the one before, until the native stack runs
out. `GetOrCreateSpec` therefore refuses to create a specialization of a
function that already has `MAXNESTEDSPECS` (16) in progress, which are
exactly the ones on the current path since checking is depth-first (§7.8,
polymorphic recursion). The error names the instantiation the call would
have made, and the chain shows the ones before it.

**Rounds** (`CheckSpecBody`). A back edge reaches a function whose returns,
shrinks, growths, stores and rebinds are not recorded yet, so a cycle is
checked in rounds until what its members record settles. The head -- the
outermost member on the call path that found the cycle -- runs them: each
round moves every member's `FnRecord` into `FnSpec::prev`, leaving a fresh
record in its place. This snapshots only the return roots and call effects,
plus the event range used to replay stores; the specialization's identity,
parameters, lexical environment and annotated body stay in `FnSpec`. The
previous record is read by `RecordOf` wherever a call applies its callee's record while the
callee is in progress: `CallResult`, `ApplyCalleeShrinks`,
`ApplyCalleeStores`, `ApplyCalleeGrows`, `ApplyCalleeLiveShrinks`,
`ApplyCalleeRebinds`, `NamedOutside`. The round marks members `stale` and
checks the head's body again on the same clone; a stale member is checked
again when a call reaches it
(`GetOrCreateSpec`), with the parameters and class roots its first round
made (`FnSpec::classroots`), so the records and the threaded classes name
the same objects across rounds. The variables outside the cycle's
activations start each round as the round before left them, so a `let`
declared outside the cycle that a round may assign is maybe assigned in the
next, where assigning it errs (§3.9): every activation shares it. In the
first round a back edge has no record: it applies no effects, and its
result points nowhere yet
(`Roots::unknown`), which every rule passes by (`FitsAt`,
`CheckRootedAtReceiver`, `BindRefProvenance`, the shrink scans), as does a
holder's contents read out of one, a variable bound to one, and a call given
one, whose specialization is keyed `RootArg::unknown`. A round that changed
no member's record (`SameRecord`: return roots, shrinks and their balances,
growths, stores through classes, pairs, rebinds), broke no threaded class
and noted no fact about a variable declared outside the cycle's activations
(`CycleRound`, marked by `NoteFact`: one variable at every level of a nested
function's recursion, which a round may have read for the next level before
it rebound it) was checked against the settled facts, so its errors stood
and it was the last; records and facts only grow and balances only worsen,
so the rounds are bounded (an internal limit of 8 holds a cycle that does
not settle). A back edge's result is the union of the roots the cycle's
returns give, mapped through
the back edge's own arguments (`RetAltVal`: a parameter class maps through
every argument the back edge gives the class's parameters, united, where an
ordinary call, whose classes group the arguments as the key's, takes the
first), read-only where any return is, a byte view where any u8 view
may be, and no slot read (§3.10), a holder's contents included, since not
every return is checked yet. A parameter the key gave static data (class 0)
has no class root for a record to name, so a back edge that passes it
storage of its own gets a holder result rooted at the activation itself,
which may only be passed down
(`CallResult`); a reference result is mapped as recorded, which parsers
passing a literal key at the entry call rely on (`samples/18_json.goose`).
What a return records drops the container it was read out of
(`RootAlt::from`), which the next round's activation would take for its own.

### 3.12 Calls, generics, literal parameters, dispatch, function values

**Resolution** (`CheckCall`, `typecheck_calls.h`): a UFCS call tries the
member builtins first when the receiver is an array, then the functions the
name reaches (a nested function in scope, else the namespace overload set),
then the remaining builtins; a plain call tries functions then builtins, with
a user overload set sharing a builtin's name (`format`) taking the calls it
matches. `ResolveCall` checks the arguments once bottom-up (phase 1),
rewriting non-fixed lvalues to references, tries every candidate
(`TryMatch`, tiers: 0 exact, 1 generic binding, 2 coercion, 3
`INTTOFLOAT`; the unique best tier below 3 wins), falls back to tag
dispatch, to a builtin of the name, then to the unique candidate
converting an integer argument to a float, then undoes that reference for a
parameter that takes the value -- a slice, or a fixed-class type an array of
another kind constructs by copy (`UnrefForValueParam`) -- re-checks each
argument against the resolved parameter type (phase 2, `CheckArg`), applies
the callee's shrinks, growths and rebinds, and maps the result roots
(`CallResult`). Generic
inference is structural (`BindTypes`, through the one coercion generics see:
whole array to slice), untyped parameters bind the argument's natural type
(a reference stays a reference), literal arguments unify after the typed
ones so a typed argument fixes the type variable, a `[]` or `null`, which
fixes none, after all of them, and leftover generics bind function values
in order.

A control construct as an argument has no destination type in phase 1,
where its value would copy the branch taken (§3.3). On the argument's value
path -- the argument itself, a UFCS receiver included, and each branch a
construct on it checks next, a nested construct, a block's tail or a
break's value (`argpath`, `PathScope`, `Scope::onargpath`) --
`CheckBranchCopy` notes that copy on the value (`Val::implicitcopy`)
instead of reporting it, as it does the `&x` branches of a fixed-size `x`
whose `&` the copy makes redundant (`Val::refcopies`), and whether every
branch is storage -- a variable, field or element of any size class, a
slice's slot included -- or a reference (`Val::storagebranches`, merged by
`MergeVals`). The value itself is no lvalue, a slice's no more than any
other (`TempCopy`), so nothing binding an lvalue by reference takes the
copy for storage. It matches a reference parameter as an lvalue does
(`UnifyArgRaw`) all the same, and `BindBranchesByRef` checks it against
that parameter before the specialization and the callee's effects are
keyed on it: each branch binds by reference (`AutoRef`), and the argument
takes the branches' merged root and writability. A slice
parameter views a construct's array branches where they lie (spec §6.4),
so `BindBranchesByRef` checks the argument against it in the same way
where phase 1 left an array, a copy of the branch taken, or arrays of two
types joined as a slice with no slice among them, which `CheckJoin` leaves
to the call on `argpath` (§3.4): those join only at a parameter declared a
slice, and `NoArrayJoin` reports them anywhere else, a failed resolution
and a builtin's UFCS receiver (which a member takes as checked) included.
A `[]` phase 1 left as the root-less placeholder (Pending arrays) is
checked against a slice parameter so as well (`ViewedWhole`), which makes
it the temporary array of the parameter's elements that the slice views
(spec §4.2): keyed on the placeholder, the parameter would point nowhere
yet, where no rule reads it, and the callee could keep a view of the
temporary.
`BindBranchByRef` does this per argument, for a parameter default as well
(`AddParamDefaults`, before `UnifyArg` judges it), and a function value's
call (`CheckFunValCall`) the same for its block's parameters. At any other
parameter phase 2 reports the copy, an untyped one included, which takes the
construct's value type, and `BindBranchByRef` the redundant `&`s as the
copy's (`RefCopyWarnings`); at a reference parameter phase 2 warns of them
as binding by reference without it. Tag dispatch binds such a construct at
the dispatch position by reference as well, and reports a copy, and the
redundant `&`s, noted on one it dispatches by value, which phase 2 does not
check again; a member builtin reports those noted on its receiver, which it
takes as checked; a function value's declared reference parameter takes its
provenance from the argument's check against it.

Phase 2 checks each argument again, and so resolves each call nested in
it again, its own two phases included. A builtin rendering a UFCS receiver
the call checked (`CheckPrintable`), tag dispatch binding the argument it
dispatches on by reference and a builtin a failed resolution falls back to
check theirs again as well, as a cycle's next round (§3.11) checks its
body again. Unlike a loop's earlier passes and a construct's first check of
its branches (`WarningsHeld`, §3.4, §3.7), none of these checks is
withdrawn: each one's warnings stand, the same ones every time. A default,
and a function value's body, are cloned anew at each check of their call,
as a function's body is per specialization, but every clone of a node
names it (`Node::origin`), and a warning prints once for the node as the
source has it, where a check first gives it (`PrintWarning`).

The tier is the worst match of any argument, not a sum of conversion
costs. Concrete exact matches beat generic exact matches, which beat any
candidate requiring adaptation; two candidates at the same best tier are
ambiguous, without a declaration-order or "more specific" tiebreaker.
Reference transparency and implicit lvalue binding participate in matching;
writing `&` can therefore select a different overload. The expected result
type does not select an overload or infer its generics. Explicit type
arguments bind the initial generic parameters in declaration order. A
selected body's error is an error at that call, not a reason to retry a
worse overload. Dispatch is attempted only when no ordinary candidate
matches, so an overload for the entire ADT takes precedence over its cases.
A candidate converting an integer argument to a float (`UnifyArgRaw`'s
`MatchInfo::INTTOFLOAT`) is no ordinary candidate here: it is taken after
dispatch and after a builtin sharing the name, and a dispatch case counts it
only where the variant has no other match, so that every call resolving
before integers converted to floats resolves as it did. Literal arguments
unify in two groups, the float ones (`LitFloat`: constants, literal
parameters and `Val::litfloat` values) before the integer ones, which then
convert to the float type the first bound. A `[]` or `null` (`Val::emptyarr`,
`Val::isnull`, a construct of either included) unifies after both groups: it
binds no type variable and only substitutes the ones the others bound
(`SubstOwn`), so it matches wherever it stands among them. A generic
candidate it matches ranks as a coercion, as a concrete one does: `f([], n)`
beside `fn f(xs: i64[], x: i64)` and `fn f<T>(xs: T[], x: T)` is ambiguous,
like `f(n, [])` for the same overloads with the parameters swapped.

**Multiple results.** Results are not tuples. An ordinary value use of a
call takes its first result and discards the others; a call statement
discards all of them, while still executing the call. `let a, b = f()`
requires exactly that many results and has no shared type annotation.
`return f()` forwards all results of a multi-result call and adapts each
one to the corresponding declared return type. Reference decay and lifetime
checks apply separately to each received result. Inference fixes a
function's result types from the first checked return; subsequent returns
must fit them, rather than widening the result by a whole-body join. A
result inferred as a reference would be inferred from the first return
checked, which a back edge reaches before (§7.8), so a function in a cycle
may not infer one (`NoInferredRefResult`): `JoinCycle` checks each function
joining a cycle, `RecordReturn` one already in a cycle inferring its result.

**Floating generic context** (§7.7): `Call::Check` passes the expected type
through named, UFCS and named-function-value calls to `ResolveCall`.
After ordinary bottom-up resolution, `ContextualFloatCall` recognizes a
single declared generic return `T` inferred as `f64` from adaptable numeric
value arguments. A trial match with typed `f32` arguments must select the
same function with only that binding changed. Explicit arguments for `T`,
already typed numeric values, compound parameters mentioning `T`, and defaults for
those parameters are boundaries. The checker records eligible call nodes
in `contextualfloats` even without an expected type, so a containing call
can recognize eligible nested computations. This does not mark their
values as literal-like: ordinary overload selection and inferred bindings
still see `f64`. At an `f32` destination, the trial's parameter types and
bindings replace the chosen match; phase 2 rechecks the arguments at those
types, recursively refining nested calls. These are ordinary typed `f32`
specializations, with no literal parameters for the refined type variable.
No runtime cast of an already computed `f64` result implements the change.

**Literal parameters** (§7.7): an argument that is a literal (or a literal
parameter passed on) to an untyped parameter, or to a bare type variable no
typed argument binds, makes the parameter a literal parameter: part of the
key (`litparams`), read inside the body as a `Val` with `unsized` set and no
constant value. Every place the value adapts to a type (`FitsAt`,
`UnifyNumeric`, branch merging) records a `LitAdapt` on the owning
specialization; passing it on as a literal records a `LitFlow`;
`VerifyLiterals` checks each call site's literal against the closure of
those records after the whole program is checked. Codegen passes the
parameter at its nominal type and casts at each use.

**Parameter defaults** (§7.1): `TryMatch` binds the written arguments to
the leading parameters (`MatchInfo::nwritten`); function values for the
leftover generics may follow as few as the parameters without a default,
and each parameter left out has the type the arguments and explicit type
arguments give it, so a default decides no type variable and plays no part
in ranking. `AddParamDefaults` clones each missing default into
`Call::args` where its argument would be (`firstdefault`, `ndefaults`) and
checks it as a written argument is checked -- in the discovery phase for the
specialization's key, where `UnifyArg` must accept it at its parameter's
type, and against its parameter in phase 2 -- but in a frame of its own
(`InParamDefault`, the `DefaultScope` a field default gets): its type
bindings are the function's own and the enclosing functions' that no inner
type parameter hides, with no function values (`ParamDefaultEnv`), its
lookups hide every local of the calling code, and its effects and the
values live around it are the caller's, as a written argument's are.
`DefaultScopeName` rejects a name the declaration's own scope would give a
parameter, a type parameter bound to a function value, or, for a nested
function, a variable or function of its `DeclSite` or such a type
parameter of a function around it; a default leading to a call that takes
it again before a top-level function's body is an error rather than an
endless check (`EachDefaultInPlace`, §3.2). `CheckCall` erases the
inserted defaults before it checks a call again, so every check (an
argument's two phases, a loop's passes, a cycle's rounds) resolves the call
as written; `Call::Clone1` drops them, and a diagnostic prints the call
without them (`dumpwritten`). Tag dispatch and rendering hooks give every
argument (`TryMatch`'s `defaults` off). Later passes see ordinary
arguments.

**Tag dispatch** (`TryDispatch`, §8.2): for each argument position holding an
enum (or a reference to one), every variant type is tried against the
overload set and exactly one candidate must match per variant; one such
position is allowed; each arm is specialized, return counts and types and
the non-dispatch parameter types must agree; a fixed-mode scrutinee
dispatches by value even through a reference, and each case takes the
payload as a match binder would (§8.1): a case taking a fixed-mode payload
by reference, or one holding self-relative references by value, is an
error; the result's provenance is the merge of the arms' (deeper root,
exact only when the same, writable only if all are). The cases get every
argument written: a call that would dispatch only by leaving parameters to
their defaults is an error.

**Nested functions** (`DeclareLocalFn`, §7.5): checking a declaration
records a `DeclSite` for the function, under the environment declaring it
(`declsiteof`): the variables in scope there, innermost first, with the
index each holds in `vars`, but those the function's own type parameters
hide (§11.1); and the functions it may call, every one declared in the
blocks around the declaration (`blockpos`), the latest at or before it
first and then those after it, followed by those the declaring body sees
outside its own scopes. The frame `CheckSpecBody` pushes for a
specialization keeps the site as `decl`, and `LookupVar` and
`LookupLocalFnEnv` look there past the body's own scopes (`ForOuterVars`,
`ForOuterFns`) instead of in the declaring frame as the call finds it, so a
scope around the call that shadows or adds a name changes nothing, and a
specialization per `lexparent` serves every call that finds the variables
the body names as its check found them (`envreads`, §3.1): a call where one
of them points or holds references elsewhere, or is assigned where it was
not or the other way round, or is a `let` that may be assigned where it
could not be or the other way round, gets a specialization of its own.
`GetOrCreateSpec` rejects
a call that reaches a nested function before its declaration is checked (a
nested function declared earlier calling it), since the variables its site
lists do not exist yet. A global initializer's frame has no environment, so
a function declared right in one has no `lexparent`, as a top-level function
has none. `LexFrame(env, sf)` tells them apart by `SFunction::isnested` and
gives such a function the initializer's frame, 0, as `LexFrame(fb)` gives a
block written there: its body's lookups continue there, through its site,
and the check above, `narrowedenv` and the depth keys (`ExternalOptionals`,
`EnvReach`) cover that frame's variables as they do a function's.
Rechecking a declaration, loop or match binding
resets its checking state while preserving its `VarDef` identity, capture
flag and the marks of §3.14 (`ResetLocal`), so cached specializations still
name the binding codegen declares. A loop's next pass, or a cycle's next
round, finds such a variable as the first found its own, so a
specialization checked then serves it; a call reusing one sets the
variables it read to where its check left them (`envexits`,
`ReplayEnvExits`; assigned where its exits agree, §3.9), as the check
itself did the first time, and notes a changed fact for the loops and
rounds around it (`NoteFact`). The same holds where the flow of another
branch dropped an assignment the check made. Before that it takes the
exits of the bodies outside it that its check took (`ReplayOuterExits`). `VisibleVars`, which the shrink rules and the read-back candidates
enumerate (§3.6, §3.10), keeps the lexical parents' frames as the call
finds them: a reference handed to the body, a later nested function's
result or one a function value written at the call returns, can point into
a variable the declaration does not see. The §5.2 scan and `NoteLiveViews`
add, inside a function value's body, the frame of the function running it
and that frame's lexical parents (`ShrinkScanVars`): the body runs in the
middle of one of its statements.

**Function values** (`CheckFunValCall`, §7.6) are restricted by `CheckV` to
names and block literals; runtime expressions producing them are rejected
rather than having their effects discarded. Returning a function value or
constructing an array of them is also rejected. A named function value
resolves as a call in the environment its declaration is in, for a nested
function the scope declaring it, whatever function names it
(`LookupLocalFnEnv`, as for a call); a block is cloned into
`Call::fvbody` and checked inline in a frame marked `isfunval` whose lexical
lookups chain to the definer, with parameters as locals bound to the
arguments (reference provenance and literal-ness carried through). The
body's value is checked without a destination, so a `[]` there has no
element type (Pending arrays, §3.2). The body
as that check sees it is a lexical environment of its own, the frame's
`lexspec`: an `FnSpec` marked `isfunval` (`NewFunValEnv`, outside
`ast.fnspecs`), whose `lexparent` is where the value was written. A nested
function declared in the body has it as `lexparent`, and a function value
written there or a nested function of the body named as one carries it, so
their lookups chain through the body's frame (`FrameOfSpec`, `LexFrame`) to
its parameters and locals (§7.5). Each check clones the body afresh and
makes a new environment with it, so a specialization
keyed on one captures that clone's variables: another call site of the
value, or the same call checked again as an argument, specializes anew
instead of reusing one whose captures codegen never declares. `NamedSpec`
gives the named function around such an environment, which a plain `return`
inside it targets (`CheckReturn`); that is how HOF-based iteration returns.

**`return ... from`** (`CheckReturn`, §7.9): the target resolves in the
returning function's definition context (a nested function in scope, else
the overload set) and is the innermost frame whose function is in that set;
every specialization between records the target in `needs`, and every path
by which a specialization was later reused (`neededges`) is re-validated
against it (`ValidateNeeds`, `AddNeed`). A long-distance return may carry
only references rooted at globals or static data -- more conservative than
the spec's "rooted at or above the target's frame" (TODO 0d). The returns of
one function may give different roots: `RecordReturn` keeps every distinct
root (`RetRoot::alts`), the writability ANDed, and every call maps and unites
them (`CallResult`, §3.4).

### 3.13 Relative references and pools

`ResolvePools` binds every `T&<w in pool>` type to its global before any type
is compared; the pool is part of the type's identity (`TypeEq`). `ValidatePool`
requires a `var` grow-only global whose elements can contain the pointee.
`PoolOf(root)` answers which global pool a root is: the global itself, or a
parameter class's `classpool`, agreed by every call site.

The relative store rule in `FitsAt` (§3.9): a null stores into any optional
relative slot. That is a value with no roots (the literal, a null-only
variable, a parameter given null, a call returning only null), and an
alternative rooted exactly at static data where that is null: the value is
writable, or `StaticCanContain` says no literal holds its pointee (a
read-only `u8` reference may point into a string literal). Such
alternatives drop out of a merged value; of the rest, the destination must
be exact (or name a pool), the value must be exactly rooted, and the two
roots must coincide -- the destination's root for the self-relative form,
the named pool for `in pool`. The diagnostic names the read-back candidates
when the value is inexact.
`index_of` needs the same exactness at the receiver. `self` (`CheckSelfInit`)
is only the whole initializer of a non-optional relative field whose pointee
is the literal's own type; the `in pool` form additionally needs the literal
to be under construction inside that pool. `NoRelRefCopy` rejects copying any
value holding self-relative references except a literal built in place
(`HasRelRefT` excludes `in pool` fields, which copy fine); the same rule
rejects by-value `for` and `match` bindings of such elements and payloads,
the elements `append` copies from anything but a literal (an element that
is itself a self-relative reference included), and a `resize` fill value,
literal or not, which is built once and copied into every slot added.
Varint-width relative references are construction-only.

A value is never relative (`FitsAt` refuses one anywhere but an identical
slot), so neither is a result: `CheckSpecBody` rejects a result type written
as a relative reference, and gives one a type argument makes relative its
loaded plain reference (`ValueType`), which the callee's returns are checked
against and the call yields. `default<T>()` of an optional relative reference
is typed the same way, as the plain null, so it exists at the varint width
too.

### 3.14 Arithmetic, constants, and the rest

`UnifyNumeric` (§6.1) unifies operands: equal types stand, a constant adapts
to the other operand's type (fit checked), a literal parameter adapts to a
typed operand, one implicit widening (`ImplicitInt`: wider same signedness,
or unsigned into strictly wider signed) wins, and the `u64`-against-signed
comparison is admitted only when the signed side's `nonneg` bit is set --
a syntactic bit from a non-negative literal, a `.len`/`.cap`, or a `let`
bound to one (`CheckVarDecl` copies it to the `VarDef` of a `let`, and the
`let` its initializer read, if any, as `nonnegfrom`). Since a writable
reference can still change a `let` (§4.4), the comparison marks each `let`
along the `nonnegfrom` chain as relied on (`RelyOnNonneg`, `nonneguse`),
`CheckRefOf` and `AutoRef` mark a variable bound to a writable reference
(`NoteWritableRef`, `refwrite`; not for an identity comparison, `index_of`
or a `const T&` destination), as `UserFormatIn` marks one print, str or
format hands whole to a `format` overload taking it by a writable
reference (§3.7), and whichever mark comes second is an error.
The marks do not follow the flow, and `ResetLocal` keeps them, as it keeps
a balanced resize's `markuse` (§3.10), so neither a loop's later pass, a
cycle's later round nor a nested function checked once gets past them. An
integer meeting a float takes the float's type, and an `f64` that takes its
type from float literals (`LitFloat`) adapts to an `f32` operand. The
checker folds constants at the operands' type (`FoldInt`, over the shared
`FoldIntOp` of `ast.h`: unsigned wraps, a shift wraps at its width too, and
a signed result that leaves the type is left unfolded for the runtime to
abort on or wrap; a constant zero divisor is an error here rather than an
abort); `ConstIntValue` evaluates the constant expressions of array sizes,
fill counts and match arms through `let` globals and arithmetic. Given the
use it evaluates for (`ConstUse`: `ConstIntOrError` and a match's
`PatternValue` pass one, a `for` range's probe for a literal end does
not), it marks every global it takes at its initializer's value, through
other globals' initializers too, as relied on (`RelyOnConstant`,
`constuse`), which `NoteWritableRef` checks as it does `nonneguse`:
whichever of the two marks comes second is an error (§11.1). A named
constant (§3.1: an untyped `let` or `const` global whose initializer's
value is a constant; `CheckVarDecl` sets `VarDef::constlit` and keeps the
value) reads as that constant (`Ident::Check`), carrying the global as
`Val::constfrom` through folds and `-`/`~`, and through the initializer of
one named constant naming another (`VarDef::constfrom`); every place it
adapts to another type (`MustFit`, `UnifyNumeric`, `MergeVals`, a literal
argument, `NoteLitArgs`) marks that chain as relied on (`RelyOnNamed` →
`RelyOnConstant`), as does a fold of two named constants for the one whose
chain it drops. `FoldInt` leaves a zero divisor from a named constant to
run time. An adapted read is emitted at its use's type (`Ident::CgX`), as a
literal parameter's is, where the optimizer did not already propagate the
value. An array
size is evaluated once per type and cached (`ArraySize`), which the
flow-free marks do not mind. `ConstIntValue` takes a name as the global of
the name, since a size is evaluated wherever its type is compared (`TypeEq`
of a callee's parameter type while a caller is checked, say). Where a size,
fill count or pattern is written, in its own scope, `ConstName` makes a
local, type parameter or nested function of the name an error (§3.3): at
a declaration's annotation (`CheckVarDecl`), a call's type arguments and
trailing block's parameters (`CheckCall`), a literal's type
(`StructLit::Check`), a fill count (`FillCount`), a nested function's
declaration (`DeclareLocalFn`) and a pattern (`PatternValue`); and
`SignatureNames` makes the sizes in every signature name none of its own
parameters or type parameters, and `TypeParamSizes` those in a generic
type's fields none of its type parameters. A type the checker writes into
a default it makes (`DefaultCall`, `DefaultValue`: `implicit` calls and
literals) and an alias's use (`TypeExpr::aliasuse`) were written, and
checked, elsewhere.

Integers become floats (§6.3) in a node of their own: `ToFloat` wraps the
integer expression in an implicit `AsCast` wherever a destination
(`CheckValue`, after `FitsAt`) or an operator (`RetypeOperands`) converts
it, so that the conversion survives whatever the optimizer makes of the
integer below it (an inlined call, a block reduced to its tail, which would
otherwise hand a float operator an integer operand). A later check of the
node sees the integer again (`AsCast::Check` of an implicit cast checks its
child) and retargets the cast rather than wrapping it twice; diagnostics
print the expression without it (`Written`). A float computed from float
literals and integers alone carries `Val::litfloat` (`Binary::Check`,
unary minus, and a block's tail through `TempCopy`) and the node flag of
the same name: typed at the literals' `f64`, it is retyped by `RetypeFlex`
wherever it meets an `f32` destination or operand -- each flagged node, the
implicit casts of its integers and its literals take the new type, while a
constant part keeps its nodes, which fold at full precision and round once.
An untyped `let`, local or global, bound to such a float (or a float
constant) is marked `VarDef::constlit` as an integer named constant is
(`CheckVarDecl`); `Ident::Check` reads it as `Val::litfloat` (with
`constflt`'s value as a constant) and `Val::constfrom`, which binary and
unary float operations and float branch joins carry on. Where it meets an
`f32` (`MustFit`, `UnifyNumeric`, `MergeVals`) `RelyOnNamed` marks it, and
`RetypeFlex` gives the identifier the `f32` type, at which `Ident::CgX`
reads the `f64` variable rounded. `ResetLocal` keeps `constuse` across a
loop's passes, so a writable reference after a relying use errs in each.
An integer computed from constants with a shift by a count that is no
constant among its operations (§6.1: `1 << k`, `(1 << k) - 1`, `~(1 << k)`)
carries `Val::flexint`, the range of those constants in `litlo`/`lithi`,
and the node flag of the same name (`NumericBinary`, `NumericUnary`): typed
`i64`, it adapts as a constant does where the range fits (`FitsAt`,
`UnifyNumeric`), and `RetypeFlexInt` retypes it there (`MustFit`,
`RetypeOperands`, a block's tail in `RetypeBranch`) -- each flagged node, a shift's left operand but not its
count, and the constants below. `~c` of a constant `c >= 0` is one too,
with `Val::notconst` saying it is exactly i64's `~c`: unary `-` takes it as
that constant, and an untyped `let` global of it is a named constant with
`VarDef::constnot`, read back as such a value. Its value at a narrower use
is `~c` wrapped, which `Ident::CgX`'s cast and the optimizer's propagated
copy (`CloneLit`, `WrapStorage`) give.

A construct's numeric branches join in `MergeVals` (§6.4): branches that are
all integer constants give a `Val::litint`, the range of the constants,
which adapts wherever a constant would (`FitsAt`, `UnifyNumeric`) to a type
the whole range fits; floats of literals, with integers among them, give a
`litfloat`; and a literal branch beside a typed one takes its type. A break
passes its value's literal form on (`CheckBreak`), and a literal one leaves
the later breaks unconstrained, as a slice join does; the `block` or `loop`
records its valued breaks (`EarlyBlock::breaks`, `LoopExpr::breaks`). The
branches' nodes take the joined type once the construct's first check
settles it (`CheckJoin` → `RetypeBranches`): an integer branch in a float
construct converts in a node of its own, a constant takes the type, a float
of literals is retyped as above; and a literal-like construct meeting a type
later is retyped the same way (`RetypeFlex`, `RetypeOperands`).

A `for` binder's written type (§6.5, `ForLoop::vartype`) makes a range's
bounds values of it (`CheckValue`) and a count a value fitted to it
(`MustFit`). The range's or the count's `exprtype` is the type the loop
counts at, which is the binder's but for an end one past the type's
largest value, a literal (`pastend`): that loop counts at i64 and binds the
binder to a copy of the counter each iteration (`ForLoop::CgStmt`), which
cannot overflow at the end. `pastend` does not evaluate an end naming
anything (`ConstExprNames`), a name being no literal: `ConstIntValue` would
fold the global of each name, which a local, a type parameter or a nested
function of the name may hide, and fail on a signed overflow or a division
by zero that the end's own check, as any expression's, leaves to run time
(§6.2). A typed index binder (`idxtype`) must hold every index the sequence
can have, and is likewise a copy of the i64 index.

**Redundant casts** (§6.3) are judged as the checker goes, check by check.
`AsCast::Check` follows a cast (`NoteCast`) where its operand converts to
its type implicitly (`Converts`: `FitsAt`'s rules for numbers, recording
nothing), outside generic code (`InGenericCode`: a function with type or
untyped parameters, a function value's body, and what is declared in either
or is a default of one): `castalts` maps the node to a `CastAlt`, the value
it would have without the cast. Each consumer of a followed value judges it.
A typed destination (`CheckValue`, a pushed element: `JudgeCastAt`) wants
the value converting to its type as the cast's does (`SameReach`: a float of
literals, or a construct of constants or of branches the destination types,
computed at the type it is now, and an integer rounding to the cast's float
type only where that is the destination's); a destination with no type (an
inferred `let`, a rendered argument) the same value, so only an identity
cast. An operator (`JudgeBinaryCasts`, `JudgeUnaryCast`) computes its value
without the cast with `NumericBinary` or `NumericUnary`, the arithmetic of
`Binary::Check` and `Unary::Check` factored out with a trial mode that
changes no node and reports no error (`unifytrial` in `UnifyNumeric`). A
call (`JudgeCallCasts`) resolves again without the cast (`MatchCandidates`):
the same function, parameter types, bindings and literal parameters, nothing
ranking alike, and then the argument meets its parameter as a typed
destination; the builtin a call takes for want of a matching function judges
nothing (`builtinfallback`). A cast around the node judges it too
(`NoteCast`), a verdict that holds only while that cast stays. Where an
operator's value without the cast differs from its own in nothing but what
its consumer can still tell -- a float of literals yet to settle
(`CastAlt::settle`, which must be the type the value now computes at) or a
constant -- the operator's node is followed in turn (`FollowCast`). A value
that decides a type before it meets it, a pending array's first element or a
generic struct literal's field, is judged as having no destination type.
`casttyped` marks the nodes whose value a followed cast's deletion changes:
where both of an operator's operands are such, each deletion is judged with
the other's as well (both may go where the value survives all three ways,
else the right one), as two arguments of a call whose overloads or generics
resolve them together are (more are not judged). A verdict waits as a
warning does (`WarningsHeld`), and once the whole program is checked
`ReportRedundantCasts` warns about each cast as written (`Node::origin`)
every check of which found it redundant, and which was not judged at a cast
that warns itself.

Builtins are one X-macro table (`builtins.h`) driving arity, receiver kinds,
provenance requirements and simple signatures; `CheckBuiltin` handles the
custom ones. `print`/`str`/`format` check renderability per type
(`CheckRenderable`) and look up a user `format` overload in the type's
namespace, then globally, specializing it with each rendered argument's
permissions and provenance (`fmtspecs`, `fmtcontexts`). Nested hooks obey
the same constraints. Their effects are applied between rendered arguments
(§3.10, **Format overloads**).
`to_bytes`/`bytes_of` require `ImageSafe` element types (no plain references,
slices or `in pool` references), `from_bytes` the stricter `VerifiableElem`
(every relative reference points at an element or a variant of it); a
`bytes_of` result carries `byteview` provenance, which the shrink scans treat
as able to point into any storage the root could image. Thread entry points
get one specialization each (`EnsureThreadSpec`) with flat parameters, and
`CheckThreadGlobals` walks a thread program's call graph rejecting non-flat
globals.

`embed_shader` is a compile-time graphics extension (`EmbedShader`, `gfx.h`).
With one argument it reads a file relative to the Goose file containing
the call (or an absolute path), inferring the GLSL stage from `.vert`,
`.frag` or `.comp`. With several arguments, the first is `"vert"`, `"frag"`
or `"comp"`; the rest are GLSL parts joined with newlines, with includes
relative to the calling file. Arguments must be string literals or chains
of immutable global names initialized by string literals, not arbitrary
constant expressions or locals. Compilation failure is a Goose compile
error. The result is a static, read-only `const u8[:]` shader blob, with no
runtime reads of the named globals. Its platform blob format and the
native graphics library interface are separate compatibility surfaces
(`gfx/gfx_blob.h`, `gfx/gfx_api.h`, `docs/design/gfx.md`), not general Goose
value layouts.

A pool's kind travels with its provenance as bits, `RU_SLOTS` for `reusable`
and `RU_SLICES` for `reusable[]` (`Prov::reusable`, `RootArg::reusable`), so
merging two branches keeps only what both allow -- a construct choosing among
pools of one kind is a pool reference, whose `gs_pref` each branch builds
(§6.1) -- and the table's
`BF_REUSABLE`/`BF_SLICEPOOL` flags each require their bit. Only a binding
whose type can carry the freelist, a plain reference to a grow-only array
(`CarriesPool`), keeps them: `BindProv` drops them for any other variable
and `GetOrCreateSpec` for any other parameter, so an optional reference to a
pool is an optional reference to an array. A pool reference variable keeps
its first binding's bits, since codegen gives it one representation for its
life (§6.1): `CheckRefRebindRoot` rejects a rebind to a value lacking one of
them. A function checked standalone (`CheckUnreached`) assumes both, which is
no reached binding's, and there a rebind narrows them instead: the rebind
settles what calls could pass. `free_slice` and `realloc_slice`
use `index_of`'s exact-root test (`RootedAtReceiver`) only to leave out a
run-time test: a slice it does not place in the pool is an error when it is
rooted exactly at a global or a variable of the checked function that the
receiver can be none of, every alternative the receiver has being another
such (a loop leaves that verdict to its settled pass, §3.7), and otherwise
sets `Call::poolcheck`, which codegen turns into a range test.
`alloc_slice` and `realloc_slice` need an element type with a default value,
and `realloc_slice` one without self-relative references (`HasRelRefT`),
since it may copy the slice.

### 3.15 Evaluation and observable storage

Left-to-right evaluation in spec §2 includes taking a value, not merely
computing a path that C might read later. These distinctions matter in the
presence of aliases (`Snapshot`, `IndexLoc`, `GenSlice`, `Assign::CgStmt`,
`EmitDispatch`):

* An earlier scalar or fixed by-value argument is sampled before later
  operands or arguments run. A reference or slice samples its address or
  view; it does not copy the storage it reaches. Later permitted writes to
  that storage remain visible through the view.
* Indexing and slicing establish the receiver's element region and length
  before evaluating the index or bounds, then evaluate bounds left to
  right. The index's element load follows its index evaluation. A later
  growth does not enlarge the earlier receiver view for this operation;
  an invalidating shrink must be rejected by the lifetime rules.
* Assignment resolves its destination before evaluating its right-hand
  side. Compound assignment also samples the old value first. Whole
  resizable assignment has the clear-before-construction semantics of
  spec §4.4; overlapping permitted copies have memmove semantics.
* A range/count `for` samples its bounds once, before iteration, and runs
  zero times for an empty or reversed range. Array iteration visits
  increasing indices and tests the current array length at each iteration,
  so permitted appends can extend the traversal. A slice's length is its
  own view length, not its owner's current length. A sequential cursor
  advances past the current element even on `continue`. A body that
  re-points a slice or rebinds a reference on the path moves the traversal
  to the elements the path leads to now, at the next index, as the length
  read again does (`ForLoop::CgStmt`): a sequential cursor walks there from
  their start, and the start of elements behind a varint length prefix is
  computed again.
* print, str and format render a value where it lies, around its format
  overloads (§3.7): an array's count and elements are read once, as its
  rendering begins, and a struct, variant or enum reached through a
  reference that can be rebound is resolved to its address before its
  first part (`RenderLoc`, `PinLoc`). An overload that re-points the slice
  or rebinds the reference leaves the rest rendered from what the
  rendering began with, which the checker holds meanwhile (`renderarg`).
  A fixed-mode ADT's payload, which an overload may overwrite with another
  variant (§3.5), is copied into a C local of its variant's type once the
  tag is read, wherever the argument has overloads, and its parts are
  rendered from there, as the variant's literal (`RenderVariant`), never
  through an overload for the variant type, which the checker only
  specializes for values of that type.
  A variable-mode ADT's payload is rendered in place, by the tag read once:
  the checker holds it, and an array's elements, while the overloads of
  their parts run (`renderwalks`).
* A by-value result that is immediately viewed still has its own temporary
  storage through the containing statement. Inlining or selecting a
  constant branch must preserve that copy when replacing it with the
  source lvalue would expose later writes (section 4, "Views of copies").

Effects include hidden calls: field defaults, rendering hooks, every
dispatch arm, and invoked function-value bodies. All must be considered
when checking shrinking, construction conflicts, optional narrowing and
when retaining bounds facts. Optimizations may remove effects only after
the program has passed the language's static checks.

---

## 4. The optimizer

`Optimizer` (`optimize.h`) rewrites the checked bodies in place before BCE
and codegen. Its one hard rule: nothing it does changes what a release build
computes, and an operation that would abort at runtime (division by zero, a
failing `as`, an out-of-bounds index) is never folded into a value or folded
away. The one licence it takes is §6.2's: debug-build overflow detection is
per operation as it executes, so tail-recursion elimination may regroup an
associative chain.

**Order.** `ReachRoots` marks the specializations reachable from `main`, the
thread entry points and global initializers (including expanded defaults), counts
call sites per specialization (`uses`), and records a call-graph postorder
(callees first; a cycle is cut at its back edge). `Analyze` collects, over
every live body first, how often each variable is written and how often its
address is taken (`facts`), so a write in another specialization's function
value is visible before any rewriting. Then: global initializers (fold
only), every specialization in postorder (`SetupBaseCase`, `OptBlock`,
`TailRecurse`, `Scan`), globals again (now able to inline), and a final
reachability pass so specializations whose every call was inlined go dead
and codegen skips them.

**Constant propagation** (`OptStmt`, `Ident::Opt`): a single-name declaration
of a scalar with a literal initializer, never written and never
address-taken, is entered in `consts`; every later use in the same walk
becomes the literal and the declaration is dropped unless captured. Constant
`let` globals propagate into every body. A parameter bound to a literal
argument is substituted at inlining time (`Inliner::BindArg`). A variable
print, str or format renders is address-taken where a `format` overload
takes it by reference (`HookedByRef`): the overload is handed the variable
itself (**Format overloads**), and may keep a reference to it or write it.

**Folding** (`Opt` per node): integer operators at the operands' checked
width (`FoldIntOp`, `ast.h`, which the checker folds with too: unsigned and
shifts wrap, a signed result only when it fits), comparisons at the
operands' signedness, float operators (at `f32` precision when both
operands are `f32`), `&&`/`||`
with a constant left, `!`, `~`, unary minus (where the result fits, as for
the binary operators; the `u64` literal 2^63 negates to exactly `i64.min`,
so a minimum written as a literal never reaches the checked negation at run
time), casts (a checked integer cast only when exact; a float-to-int only
in range and integral; a conversion to a float of anything but a `u64`
above `i64.max`), `.len` of a fixed array
and `.cap` of a static-capacity limited array on a plain variable receiver,
`if` on a constant condition, `match` on a constant integer, `while false`,
`assert(true)`, and statements after a `return`, `break` or `continue` in a
block.

**Inlining** (`TryInline`): a call is replaced by an `InlineBlock` holding
the callee's parameter bindings as `VarDecl`s (marked `inline_arg`, evaluated
in the caller's scope so an argument temporary outlives the returned value)
followed by a `Cp1` copy of the body; a `Return` whose target is the inlined
function exits the block with its values (`Return::CgStmt`), which is what
keeps early returns, `return from` and function-value returns working through
any nesting. The copy is re-folded so substituted constants cascade. A
trivial result unwraps to a plain expression when its type survives. A call
passed where a slice is expected keeps that slice as its checked type while
the body returns the array; codegen builds the array where the call would
have put its result, a temporary of the caller's scope, and slices it whole
(`InlineBlock::CgAny`), since the body's own scopes release their storage
when it exits. Where the body's `return` delivers another type than the call
was checked as -- the reference itself where the call site decayed it to its
pointee, a slice where a limited array is wanted -- the destination loads or
adapts the value as its type asks (`GenXD`, `CallVal0`): every lvalue
destination an inlined body can reach names that type (`Dst::t`), the
temporary a function value's call's value lands in and the global an
initializer sets among them.
The thresholds per call site of callee K: inline if K is used once, or its
post-optimization node count is below NC, or count times uses is below NCU
(`-O1`: 8/48, `-O2`: 16/96). Never inlined (`Scan`): a `recursive` function
or cycle member, a `thread_fn`, a function returning more than one value, and
a body that a *separate* live tree still references -- a remaining call to
a nested function or to a specialization with bound function values reaches
its locals as free variables, and a remaining callee that does `return ...
from` it needs its frame. Nothing is inlined *into* a cycle member (its
locals would become the cycle's own).

**Views of copies** (`OptViewed`). The value of a call, of a bare block and
of an `if` or `match` is a temporary copy (§9.2), and the checker takes a
view of it for a view of a temporary of its own (`TempRoot`), which nothing
else in the statement writes or shrinks. Unwrapping an inlined result, or
folding a statement-less block into its tail and an `if` or `match` into
the branch taken, can reduce that value to a path into the storage it was
copied from: harmless where the value is copied out, but where it is viewed
where it stands the view would then see the rest of the statement write or
shrink that storage. Those places are a slice's base, an index's base where
the index runs code (the element is read after it; `CodeFree`), a `for`'s
iterable, the operand of `&` (explicit, or a reference parameter binding
it), a member builtin's receiver (`bytes_of` returns a view of it), and the
base of a field or element that is itself viewed or is an array a slice
destination takes whole. There such a path, or `&` of one (which codegen
addresses as the path, `GenLoc`), goes back into a block, which codegen
evaluates into a temporary as the construct would have:
`f(get()[..], a.pop())` for `fn get() -> i64[3] { a[0] }` would otherwise
hand `f` a view of the slot the pop frees. An argument print, str or format
renders while user `format` overloads run is one more (`OptRendered`): it
is read where it stands around them, and handed where it lies to one taking
it, or a part of it, by reference, and they may write the storage a path
names or re-point it. There a path of any type goes back into a block, a
slice's or a scalar's as well, so that an overload is given the temporary
the checker took the argument for (**Format overloads**).

**The nesting limit** (`MAXNEST`, 64). Every inlined body is a C block of
its own, and C compilers limit how deep blocks nest in one function: MSVC
to 128 (C1061), clang outside its MSVC-compatible mode to 256
(`-fbracket-depth`). Under the thresholds alone, a chain of single-use
functions, each calling the next, folds into one body as deep as the chain
is long; and as each inline copies a body with everything already inlined
into it, while the original stays allocated, the cost is quadratic in the
chain's length: 6.5 GB and most of a minute for a chain of 2000 in a Debug
build. So, whatever the thresholds say, a call is inlined only while the C
blocks around it plus those the callee's body nests stay within `MAXNEST`.
Such a chain then folds into one body per 64 levels, each calling the next,
and takes 2 s and 240 MB (0.7 s and 170 MB at `-O0`). Both counts are of
what codegen opens a C block for: every `Block` (a function or inlined body,
an arm, a loop body; not a flat `if`'s then-block, §6.2, which `Around`
takes back), one around an `else` that is not a `Block`, the right
operand of `&&` and `||`, a `while` condition (tested inside the loop), the
arguments of a function-value call (bound inside its block) and an array's
fill value (conservatively counted with its repetition loop), and two
around a match arm (a switch and its case); `Around` counts the ones around
a child. `Scan` records the deepest
nesting of each final body (`InlineInfo::nest`, the `nest` of `--specs`),
and the walk keeps the count around the node it is at (`depth`), taken as
the blocks stand when it gets there: one that folds away afterwards only
makes it cautious. The other half of MSVC's limit is for the blocks codegen
opens around runtime work, which are not counted. Ordinary programs stay
far below the limit: the deepest inline in the tests, samples and
benchmarks lands 18 blocks deep.

**Base-case inlining** (`BaseCaseInliner`, `optimize_basecase.h`): a
`recursive fn` whose body *starts* with `if c { return e; }` (or the negated
`if c { … } else { return e; }` that `guard c else { return e; }` parses
to), with every parameter fixed-size, `c` a pure read of parameters and
globals, and `e` calling nothing in the cycle, gets each direct self-call
`f(a...)` rewritten to `{ let p = a; ...; if c[p] { e[p] } else {
f(p...) } }` under the inliner's size thresholds. This removes
half the calls of a complete tree walk. The bindings are marked
`inline_arg`, like an inlined call's, and made in the scope around the block
(`GenInlineArgs`): a slice argument can view a temporary, which has to last
while the callee runs and while the block's value is used. It does not fire
when a statement precedes the base case, on mutual recursion, on
UFCS-spelled self-calls, or on a self-call whose array result is passed
where a slice is expected: the array has to outlive the `if`, and each arm
would build it in a scope of its own.

**Accumulator tail-recursion elimination** (`TailRecursion`,
`optimize_tre.h`, `-O1` and above): a directly self-recursive
specialization returning one machine integer, whose tail returns are
`self(args)` or `E op self(args)` (or `self(args) op E` with `E` pure) with
one associative operator (`+ * & | ^`), becomes `var acc = identity; loop {
... }`: each tail call turns into `acc op= E`, rebindings of the parameters
(all at once through temporaries when several change) and `continue`; every
other return folds `acc` in. Self-calls in non-tail position stay calls, so
`1 + check(l) + check(r)` loses its right spine only. Parameters must be
rebindable (scalars, or plain non-fat, non-pool, non-relative references
whose new value is root-stable), tails inside loops or function-value bodies
are skipped, and a callee that can `return ... from` the function disables
the transform. The `var t = ...; if c { t op= self(x) } t` spelling is
restated as a return first (`AccVarForm`).

---

## 5. Bounds-check elimination

`BCE` (`bce.h`) runs over every live specialization after the optimizer and
marks the `Index` and `SliceExpr` nodes whose runtime check cannot fire;
codegen then omits the check. It is required only to be sound; a program's
meaning never depends on it (§10.5). It is also where two codegen decisions
are taken that are not about checks at all: `ForLoop::fixedlen` and the
per-loop `hoistrefs` (§5.10).

### 5.1 The domain

A flow-sensitive **difference-constraint** domain: facts of the form
`l <= r + c` over *bases*, where a base is the constant zero, an integer
variable, the length of a *place* (an array or slice location), or a
one-shot temporary base for a value the operation itself bounds. A query
"is `l <= r + c` provable" is a shortest path over the fact graph plus the
axioms (`Dist`, Bellman-Ford with saturating weights); the smallest provable
`c` is the distance. Facts are capped at 200 per state (the oldest is
dropped), offsets on variable bases at 2^32, constants at 2^60, and
anything larger is "unprovable" rather than wrong.

Every query uses these **axioms**: `0 <= len <= 2^48` for every length
(§10.4 is what makes `len - 1`, `i + 1` and `len + len` provably free of
overflow), the storage range of every sub-64-bit integer variable, and the
invariants granted by the recording pass (§5.7).

### 5.2 Bases and generations

Every base carries a **generation**: `(v, g)` is the value the variable or
length held while generation `g` was current. A **kill** (`BumpVar`,
`BumpPlace`) opens a new generation rather than deleting facts, so what was
known about the old value stays true about the pinned old value. That is what
makes a `for i in n` loop's entry snapshot sound across iterations, and what
lets an `Index` compare its receiver's length as it was *before* the index
expression ran (`Index::BceWalk` drops the length term if evaluating the
index moved anything).

A length mutation with known direction bridges the generations: a grow adds
`old <= new`, a shrink `new <= old`, so a bound established before a `push`
still holds after it and a `pop` cuts it. A push or a constant-length append
is an exact step (`ExactLenStep`: `new == old + k`); `clear`, `resize(n)`,
a fresh literal, a slice binding and a rebind to a known place set the length
exactly (`ExactLenIs`). Monotone integer variables (§5.7) get the same
bridges across their kills.

### 5.3 Terms

`TermOf` reads a machine-integer expression as *base + offset*: a literal;
an integer variable that is not `u64` or `varint`; `.len` of a place (a
fixed array's length is a constant); `x + c`/`x - c` at `i64` only (narrower
widths wrap below the 64-bit math the facts are stated in); `a % b` and
`a & b`, which land in `[0, b]` on a fresh base when `b` is provably
non-negative (a negative signed mask proves nothing); a cast whose value the
facts already place inside the target's range, which is the identity and
carries its operand's term; `a * b` and `a ± b` with two moving operands,
handled by *intervals*: where both operands have finite constant bounds the
result gets a fresh base bounded by the four corner products or the summed
ranges, stated only when it fits the operation's own width (release-mode
wrapping, §6.2); and the value of an `InlineBlock` or bare block. An
operation's width is its operands' type (`OpType`), not its `exprtype`,
which is the possibly wider slot the value lands in (§3.3). Derived
terms are memoized per node and invalidated by any generation change
(`Derived`), and an expression whose later operand changed tracked state is
not rebuilt from its operands' current names (`effectfulterms`).

A term is admissible as a comparison side (`CmpAdmissible`) only if the
machine comparison equals the mathematical one: a variable with a zero
offset, any constant, a length plus a small constant.

### 5.4 Places and aliasing

A **place** is an array or slice location nameable as a variable plus a chain
of struct fields, with reference crossings marked, and an "ultimate" owner:
owned storage (the root variable), static data, or opaque (a stored
reference read on the way, an inexact root). `UltOf` follows reference and
slice provenance to the owning variable; a synthetic parameter class is
opaque as storage but two references in distinct classes are known distinct.
A slice's length is held in the slot the slice lies in -- a variable, a field,
an element -- so a place reached through a reference to a slice is owned by
the slot the reference is rooted at (§3.4): `UltOf`'s slot mode stops at a
slice variable rather than following it on to the array it views.
Storage is **reachable** to a callee or an unknown reference only if its
owner is a global, is captured, or has its address taken (`Reach`): creating
any reference into a variable requires one of those. `AffectedByWrite`
decides whether a write to one place, to owned storage, or to unknown
storage may name another place; distinct plain paths under one owner are
distinct arrays.

### 5.5 Kills

What invalidates a fact: a grow or shrink builtin (the receiver takes the
exact delta, every place it may alias the directional bump); a whole-value
write to a variable or through a chain (`StorageWriteKill`: everything under
that owner, or everything reachable when the target is unknown); a rebind of
a reference variable (`RebindKill`); a slice stored into a slot, by assigning
a slice variable or through a reference to a slice (`SlotWriteKill`: every
slice place that slot may be -- the variable, each reference to it, any
reachable slot when the slot is unknown -- while the arrays the slices view
keep their lengths); any other pointee write through a reference
(`PointeeWriteKill`); a store of a value holding a length (`HoldsLen`) into
or inside an array element, or a grow or shrink of an array inside one
(`ElementLvalKill`: no place lies in an element, but a reference to or into
one measures what it holds, so every such place over the storage the
elements lie in -- never a resizable array's, which no element is -- or
anything reachable where a reference the element holds leads out of it); a
repeated declaration inside a loop; and a call. A call with no summary kills
everything reachable plus every reachable integer variable (`KillByCall`); a
call with a summary kills exactly what the summary names (§5.8). Integer
writes shift facts in place when the pre-state provably cannot wrap
(`ShiftCore`: `i++` moves every fact about `i` by one) and kill the variable
otherwise; a set `v = e` re-pins `v` and records `v == e` when `e` has a term
that cannot have wrapped.

### 5.6 Facts from control flow

`CondFacts` adds the comparison of an `if`, `while`, `assert` or
short-circuit operand (both senses, through `!`, `&&` and `||`), an integer
`match` arm's range (the hull of a listed arm's values and ranges), and a
`for` header's bounds (`0 <= i < n` against the snapshots taken at loop
entry for ranges and counts, against the re-read length for arrays and
slices). A condition that itself changed tracked state
-- a mutating call inside it -- adds nothing (`HasKillEffects`), since the
comparison ran against pre-kill values. A completed `pop` proves the old
length was at least one; a `resize` states the new length when the count's
term survived the fill value's evaluation.

Joins are the **meet** of the branch states (`Meet`: a fact survives with the
weaker constant, generations take the maximum); a branch that diverges
contributes nothing.

### 5.7 Loops and invariants

Every loop body is walked first in kills-only mode (`StripKills`) to
invalidate whatever an earlier iteration may have changed, then for real;
a `while` condition's facts re-establish at every body entry, and its
negation holds after the loop only if the body has no `break`. Facts
established by an `EarlyBlock` or an `InlineBlock` with early exits are
likewise reduced to their kills at the join.

Since a kill loses the `i >= 0` and `i <= len` facts that the classic
`var i = 0; while i < a.len { ...; i++; }` needs, each body runs in three
modes (`RunSpec`): a **kills** walk producing the whole-body summary of
bumped places and rebound variables; a **recording** walk that, for every
eligible local integer variable (single-name declaration, not captured, not
address-taken, no compound write other than `±constant`), checks that every
write preserves `v >= 0`, that no write can wrap at the variable's width,
and that `v <= len(P)` survives for each place `P` the variable indexes or
bounds and that is never shrunk or re-bound in the body (growth alone never
breaks it); and the **judging** walk, which is granted the survivors as
axioms (`ge0`, `lelen`) and the wrap-free, single-direction variables that
are never plainly assigned as monotone (`mono`). Global integer variables
get the same `>= 0` treatment across the whole program
(`ValidateGlobalInvariants`: the initializer is the base case, every write in
every live body the step), which is what a parse cursor kept in a global
needs.

### 5.8 Across calls

**Effects.** `ComputeEffects` summarizes every live specialization, to a
fixpoint over the call graph, as the storage its body may resize or
overwrite beyond its own locals -- by parameter index for what it reaches
through a reference parameter's class, by variable for globals and captured
locals -- and the integers it may write; a write the walk cannot attribute
makes the summary opaque. An `extern fn` may resize or write whatever it is
handed by reference and nothing else. `CallKills` then kills exactly the
places those effects name at the arguments bound to them, so a length fact
survives a call to a kernel that only reads and writes elements. No callee
resizes a slice argument or a reference to one (`KillSliceArg`): through the
reference it may store another slice into the slot, which is that slot's kill
(§5.5), and through either it may write the elements the slice views, where
only a reference into an element measures a length, and only where the
element type holds one (`HoldsLen`, `ElementWriteKill`). A class of this
body's own parameters names none of its variables (`KillClassWrite`), but
the class an inlined body's parameter kept stands for this body's arguments
to it, so storage named through that may be anything reachable.

**Entry facts.** Every call site (`RecordSite`) records what it proves about
the arguments: each integer argument's term as sampled right after it was
evaluated, each passed array's length (a slice expression's is what its
bounds just stated, a literal's its count), and how they relate pairwise
(`Sites`: a matrix of the weakest `X <= Y + c` any site established).
`SeedEntryFacts` grants a specialization the meet of its sites on entry once
every site has been analyzed -- callers are analyzed before callees for
this -- and only if nothing reaches it another way: a thread spawn, a
`format` overload called by `print`, or any use the optimizer counted that
the call scan did not see makes it opaque. A site inside a recursive cycle
is walked after its callee and contributes nothing. This is what carries
`src.len == W * W` from `main` into `blur(src: u8[>..]&, ...)`.

### 5.9 Judging

`JudgeIndex` marks `a[i]` when `0 <= i` and `i <= len - 1` are provable
against the length as it stood when the receiver was evaluated; `JudgeSlice`
marks `a[lo..hi]` when `0 <= lo <= hi <= len`, each bound in the state it was
evaluated in, and records the slice's length as `hi - lo` when the domain can
name it (both bounds on one base, or a constant lower bound), which the
declaration binding the slice then takes (`slicelen`). Codegen separately
elides a constant index into a fixed array (`IndexLoc`).

### 5.10 What else the pass decides

* `ForLoop::fixedlen`: for an array or slice loop, whether the body's kill
  summary leaves the iterated place alone, in which case codegen reads the
  view once instead of re-reading the length every iteration (section 3.15 makes
  growth during iteration legal, so the re-read is the default).
* `hoistrefs` on every loop: the reference variables the loop indexes whose
  array the body (and a `while` condition) can neither grow, shrink, rewrite
  whole nor reach through a call; codegen reads their base and length into
  locals before the loop (section 6.10).

### 5.11 Verification

`--bce-test` checks `// bce:elide` and `// bce:keep` comments: every check on
such a line must have the annotated outcome. The `test/optimizer/bce*.goose` fixtures
check these decisions and also run as ordinary programs, allowing output
checks to catch incorrect elimination. `--bce-lines` prints the per-line counts
for comparing two builds of the pass; `bench/bce_ab.py` measures the whole
pass against `--no-bce`.

### 5.12 Known gaps

Indices loaded from array contents (`dist[q[i]]`) have no known range and
keep their check. An analysis of array-content invariants was implemented
and measured, then dropped because it produced no measurable speedup
(`bench/adoption.md`). A `u64` variable is never a
base, so a `u64` local loses the range its initializer had (TODO 0a). Loop
exit conditions that are disjunctions are not represented (TODO 0f). A
value read out of a field or element (only variables and lengths are
bases), a value through a call without a summary, and anything after a
shrink stays unproven until re-established.

---

## 6. Code generation: representation

`CodeGen` (`codegen.h`) emits one C file; the runtime (`src/runtime/`) is
embedded in the compiler (`runtime_inline.h`, regenerated by
`--gen-runtime-header`), and the driver assembles the file around what
codegen emits (§7 has which parts of the runtime go where). The
representation follows Appendix C, with the choices recorded in Appendix E. The following sections describe
the representations and their implementation.

### 6.1 Values

The C backend targets 64-bit, little-endian hosts with unaligned packed
accesses. Integer and floating widths are their declared widths; `bool`
occupies one byte and valid values encode as 0 or 1. Array metadata is
counted in elements, except the outer serialization frame, which counts
payload bytes (section 6.9). A stored length must represent the actual
count exactly; truncating it would change where subsequent fields start.
Known counts are checked statically; dynamic counts are checked before
storing or patching the length field.

Layout details needed for byte/C compatibility (`FixedSize`, `LayoutFields`,
`LenStore`, `TagStore`):

* A default variable-array length is `u32`; `T[uN]` uses that unsigned
  width, and `T[varint]` uses unsigned LEB128. Static limited-array length
  widths are 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes at capacities 255, 65535 and 2^32−1.
  Runtime limited arrays store `u32 capacity`, then `u32 length`, then all
  capacity slots; assigning one preserves the receiver's capacity.
* ADT tags are zero-based declaration indices, one byte for up to 256
  variants, otherwise two bytes. A standalone variant payload has no tag;
  a variant reference into an ADT addresses the payload after the tag.
* `pad n` contributes exactly `n` bytes. In a fixed layout, bare `pad`
  aligns the next real field to its scalar storage width (8 for plain
  references and slices; 1 for composite fields). It adds nothing in a
  variable layout or without a following field. There is no implicit
  aggregate tail padding. A struct with no bytes of its own (no fields, and
  no `pad n`: `EmptyLayout`) occupies one, the `gs_empty` byte C gives it.
  A variant with none occupies none behind its ADT's tag and has no member
  in a fixed-mode ADT's union, though its own C struct has that byte, which
  is why spec §3.4 keeps its type out of fields and elements.
* Padding, inactive ADT payload bytes and unused limited-array slots are
  not value-bearing. Structural equality ignores them. Raw byte images
  can include them, so equal values need not serialize byte-for-byte
  identically, and callers must not infer zeroing from fresh OS pages.

* **Fixed-size types** are packed C types (`#pragma pack(1)`): scalars,
  packed structs, fixed and static-capacity limited arrays wrapped in structs
  (`{ T e[k]; }`, `{ len; T e[k]; }`, with one slot where `k` is 0, since C
  has no empty arrays: that slot would take bytes the layout does not count,
  which is why spec §3.4 keeps such arrays out of fields and elements),
  fixed-mode ADTs as `{ tag; union }`,
  plain references as pointers, slices as `{ data, len }`, relative
  references as their stored integer. An empty slice's `data` is null where
  the slice was zero-filled (`default<T>()`, a default element), and C leaves
  `memcpy` and `memcmp` undefined on a null pointer even for zero bytes, so
  copies and compares out of a slice go through the runtime's `gs_memcpy` and
  `gs_memcmp` (`ArrView::nullable`, `CopyFn`). `CT` emits typedefs on first use;
  struct-like kinds get a forward typedef so a node type can reference
  itself (`NameCT`), and their body at the first use by value or through a
  pointer (`PointeeLv`): a struct the program only reaches through
  references gets it at the first access through one. Every program name
  carries the `_g` suffix (`Sanitize`), namespaced ones the namespace's
  length as well.
* **Bytes values** (variable class) are self-describing byte images held as
  a `uint8_t *` to the value's start; a field behind a variable-size field
  is reached by a cursor that walks the intervening sizes (`FieldPtr`,
  `SizeX`, with a generated `gs_size_<T>` walker per dynamic type).
* **Resizable values** are a header in the owning frame -- `gs_rhdr { base,
  len }` -- with the elements on a data stack, or, for a frame object, the C
  struct of the fixed fields with the tail's header (or nested frame object)
  as its last member (`EmitCFields`). Growth bumps the stack top and the
  count; the base never moves. A frame object's type as the tail of a
  resizable that is not one is bytes of that value like its other fields
  (`FoBytes`): a literal builds it so, anything else as a C frame object
  whose elements land behind room left for the fixed fields
  (`GenFoAsBytes`), and a whole read loads it into one that views the
  elements in place (`FoView`).
* **Fat references** (`gs_rref { hdr, stk }`) are references to
  resizable-class values: the header address plus the stack, so a callee can
  push through them. A reference with `reusable`-pool provenance is a
  `gs_pref`, which adds the freelist's header and stack. Whether a parameter
  is fat or pool-shaped comes from the specialization's types and
  `RootArg::reusable`, not from surface syntax; a variable is pool-shaped
  (`PrefVar`) by its binding's bits, which its rebinds keep (§3.14), and
  each binding and rebind stores a whole `gs_pref` (`GenPrefVal`): an `if`,
  `match` or block choosing among pools builds one in each branch, into a
  temporary the construct is generated to as a destination asking for the
  pool form (`Dst::pool`).
* String literals are `static const` byte arrays (`StrRaw`), sliced as
  `{ data, len }` or emitted as static `[len][bytes]` images when used as a
  `u8[]` value (`GenStrBytes`).

### 6.2 Stack assignment

Stack assignment is the hidden-argument strategy §10.3 permits: every
function that uses data stacks takes `int64_t gs_sp`, addresses its own
nonfixed locals and temporaries as `GS(gs_sp + k)` with a per-function
constant `k` (`AllocStk`), calls callees with `gs_sp + <indices in use>`
(`SpTop`), and asks the runtime once at entry to have that many stacks
(`GS_ENSURE`, which reserves lazily). Globals own dedicated stacks outside the
indexed block. Scopes mirror C braces (`CScope`): every nonfixed local's base
pointer doubles as the watermark restored at scope exit, and every exit path
-- fallthrough, `break`, `continue`, `return`, propagation -- emits the
restores of the scopes it leaves in reverse declaration order
(`EmitExitRestores`). A statement gets a scope of its own (`SC_STMT`) so a
temporary's stack is free again at the next statement, and so does the
right operand of `&&` and `||`, whose temporaries exist only when it runs;
a local's allocation skips the statement scopes inside its block
(`AllocStk(forlocal)`), and no further: its index is free again once the
block ends, for the locals and calls that follow (what lets a recursive
cycle's functions own scratch, §7.8).

One scope has no braces: the then-block of a flat `if` (§3.9). Its `else`
cannot complete normally, so what follows `if (!c) { else }` runs exactly
where `c` holds, and the then-block's contents are emitted there, in the C
block the `if` is in, its restores still closing its scope. A run of
guards so nests no C blocks, however long (MSVC stops at 128 levels, clang
at 256). C names are unique within a function (`T`, `Unique2`), so what
the then-block declares clashes with nothing there.

Because a `uint8_t *` store may alias a stack's `top` in C, the tops of the
stacks a function owns are cached in locals where the function grows them
(section 6.10).

### 6.3 Globals and program instances

Every global that is not read-only static data is a member of one
`gs_globals_t` struct per program instance, with the dedicated stacks of the
resizable ones inside it; main's is a static, a worker's is allocated by its
entry thunk and filled from the spawn image (§6.8). Access is `GS_GL->name`,
which is `(&gs_globals_main)` in a program without workers and the
thread-local `gs_gl` with them. A `let` (or `const`) global of a `const`
flat fixed type with a compile-time initializer (`StaticInitX`, up to 256
array elements) is a C static shared by every instance; a `var` of such a
type can be assigned as a whole and is a member like any other. Everything
but the statics is initialized by `gs_init_globals` in declaration order.

### 6.4 The calling convention (C.3)

`SigParams`, in order: the declared parameters (a by-value resizable adds
its `gs_stack *`; a pool parameter is one `gs_pref`; a bytes value is a
`uint8_t *`); the free variables of a nested function or function value
(fixed ones by pointer, resizables as header pointer plus stack, pools as
`gs_pref`); result channels in source result order (out-pointers for fixed
results other than the first fixed result; per nonfixed result a
destination `gs_stack *` and, for a resizable, the count out-parameter or
frame object out-parameter); and `gs_sp` when the function touches stacks.
The C return value is the first fixed result, even when it is not result
zero; with none it is `void`.
A multi-value binding takes each fixed result straight into its variable
(`EmitCallInto`), except a reference result the checker decayed to a copy of
its fixed-size pointee (§4.1): that one arrives in a temporary and is loaded
through it, as the destination's type (`Dst::t`) asks. A return forwarding a
call's results, to the function's caller or to a `return from` target's
channels, converts each one the checker adapted (`GenForward`, §6.5).
`CollectSpecs` computes per specialization, to a fixpoint over the call
graph, the free variables it or its callees need, the stack-owning globals
it can reach, and whether it needs `gs_sp` at all. A body without it counts
its stack indices from 0, which are the outermost callers' stacks, so it
needs `gs_sp` wherever it builds anything on one: a node of a nonfixed type,
and what no node's type shows -- a call's result built as its own nonfixed
type where the checker fitted the call to a fixed-size slot (`str()` passed
as a slice or returned as a `u8[..16]`, `to_bytes()` passed as a slice), a
payload a match arm copies by value, a variable-mode scrutinee a dispatch
copies for its by-value arms, a variable-mode value (a reference result's
pointee included) adapted to a fixed-mode ADT, anything rendered
structurally into a limited array. `EmitSpec` rejects a body that allocates
a stack without `gs_sp` as an internal error. A global initializer's locals
belong to no specialization: they are free variables of every function
naming them, which `gs_init_globals` passes as a function passes its own.

### 6.5 Destinations and in-place construction

Every value-producing node is emitted against a destination (`Dst`): discard,
a C lvalue, or the top of a data stack with, for resizable results, the
lvalue that receives the count (or the frame object). `GenAny` routes a node
to its destination; control constructs recurse so every branch constructs at
the same place (§4.3); `GenConstruct` writes a value front-to-back at a stack
top; calls pass the destination stack down as the hidden argument, and a call
in `v.append(f())`, or in `v.push(f())` for a variable-size element, builds
straight at `v`'s top (`EmitPush`, `EmitAppend`). Element-run results (§7.3)
exist for variable *array* results: `EnsureEr` compiles a second, `_er` twin
of the callee that emits raw elements plus a count, so `v.append(f())` is
contiguous; a callee without a twin (a builtin, a dispatch, a `return from`
target) delivers the value form and the receiver slides the length prefix
out with one `memmove` (`EmitSlidePrefix`). A `T[]` result landing in a slot
of another length storage is re-prefixed afterwards (`EmitReprefix`). A
runtime-capacity limited result (`T[..]`) has no run form: `EmitAppend`
builds its image on the destination stack, then compacts its live elements
over the header and discards unused capacity. Inlined calls retain named
result placement for identical packed layouts, and control expressions pass
the same destination through their branches. These packed
layout relocations are the exception in spec §4.3; they do not use a
separate result stack. A fresh result appended to a limited receiver still
requires staging while its final count is unknown, to check capacity before
writing the receiver; spec §4.3 permits this separate bounded-destination
exception.
An appended literal of variable-size elements is built the same way, its
elements at `v`'s top and its count added to the length (`GenArrayLit`);
one of fixed-size elements holding relative references is a fixed array
laid over the slots it fills, at the top or in a limited array's free
slots, and built there (`FixedArrayLitAt`), so each offset is measured from
where it stays. Other fixed-size elements are evaluated into a C temporary
and copied, as a pushed one is stored after it is evaluated.

A stack destination also names the slot's type wherever the receiver knows
it: a local's, a global's, a parameter's, an array literal's element type, a
temporary's own. The value is built as that type whatever the expression's
own type says: a call's variable-array result takes the slot's length
storage, a reference stores a relative slot's offset (§3.9), and `str()` and
`to_bytes()`, whose results are resizable, reserve the slot's length prefix,
write their elements behind it and patch it (`EmitStr`, `OpenRzDest`), so
`[str("a"), str("bc")]` builds each string in its element. A varint field
or element takes the `i64` every varint read decodes to (§3.6) from
whatever produces it -- a control construct or an inlined body through a C
temporary (`CtlValX`), a returned `varint&` through its load (`CallVal0`,
`GenXD`), a fill value once -- and writes it zigzag-encoded
(`EmitVarintStore`). A call reached
through `GenAny`, as a branch's value, is constructed by `GenConstruct` like
any other. A reference's pointee meeting a value slot -- a returned reference
whose value is taken, or the reference an inlined body leaves in the slot --
is built as the slot's type from where it lies (`ConstructFromLoc`): a `u8[]`
pointee takes a `u8[varint]` element's prefix, and an element run's none.
`v.append(copy(x))` appends `x`, whose elements the run copies anyway. The
`_er` twins are compiled last, after the globals' initializers, which can
ask for one too.

**Pushes** (`EmitPush`). The receiver is evaluated, then the argument, then
the element is added (§2), and the argument may itself grow the array
(`v.push(v.push(1))`, `v.push(f(v))`): a fixed-size element is therefore
evaluated before its slot is claimed, so it follows whatever the argument
pushed and the returned reference names it. A variable-size element, and a
fixed one holding relative references of either form (a self-relative
offset measures from where the element lives, an `in pool` `self` is its
position in the pool), are built in the slot instead -- for limited
arrays too -- which is what the checker's growth rule (§3.10) keeps safe.
A pool allocation builds a literal holding relative references at its
slot the same way (`EmitAlloc`): a slot off the freelist is taken first,
and a fresh one at the top is counted only once the element is written, so
nothing the literal's initializers call can read it half-built.

**Adaptation into limited arrays.** `FitsAt` lets any array
or slice of the element type construct a `T[..k]` (§4.2), and codegen copies
into the C value (`AdaptToFixed`, with the capacity check) from whatever
representation the source has: a variable or field through `LoadLoc`, a
slice expression in `SliceExpr::CgX`, a call result through `CallVal0`
(`CallResLoc`: the temporary header of a resizable result, the base pointer
of a variable one, the pointee of a reference result), a node in another
representation than its context wants through `GenXD` (a `copy` source, a
spliced callee body), and a stack slot through `GenArrayFromLoc`. A
bytes-class call result feeding a fixed-class slot is built on a temporary of
its own rather than the slot's stack (`GenConstruct`), since the slot takes
the adapted C value. A runtime-capacity `T[..]` is a bytes value, and an
assignment into one copies out of a value of that layout (`GenPtr`): a slice
or an array of another kind is built as one on a temporary first
(`ConstructFromLoc`), so the source is read in full before the destination
changes, even a view into the destination itself.

**Adaptation into variable-size arrays.** Any array or slice of the element
type constructs a variable, resizable or runtime-capacity limited array too
(§4.2). A call's fixed-size array or slice result, a C value, is constructed
from where it lies as the slot's type (`ConstructCall`, `ConstructFromLoc`),
as a returned reference's pointee is. A variable-size result is handed the
slot only where the call's convention delivers it in the slot's layout
(`CallBuildsAt`): its own for the same type, a variable array's elements as
a run or behind the slot's length prefix (`EmitReprefix`), a resizable
function result copied from behind a header of its own, and a builtin's
resizable result behind a variable array's prefix (`EmitStr`,
`OpenRzDest`). Any other -- a runtime-capacity limited array, a variable array
for one, `str()` for one -- is built on a temporary of its own and
constructed from there. An inlined callee's `return` builds its value in the
caller's slot, typed as the callee's result, and the inliner replaces a call
whose body only returns a value by that value. `GenConstruct` builds an
array that is not fixed-size there as the slot's type, an array literal
included (`GenArrayLit`), and takes a fixed-size array or slice as its own
type first, a C value, so that a limited array's capacity is checked as the
callee's return checks it, then constructs the slot's type from that. A `[..cap]`
literal taking another type is empty: it is built as its own on a temporary,
which checks the capacity's range, and copied.

**Adaptation into an ADT.** `FitsAt` also lets a variant construct its ADT,
and an ADT construct itself in its other mode (§3.5); the node then carries
the ADT's type, and codegen finds the type the value arrives as where it is
produced. A variable, field or element converts where it is read: into a
fixed-mode ADT as a C value tagged with the variant (`LoadLoc`,
`AdaptToFixed`), into a variable-mode one as the tag followed by the value's
bytes (`GenVarEnumFromLoc`). A call's result, a builtin's element result
included, and an inlined body arrive as the callee's own type (`AdtFrom`):
`GenAdtAdapted` builds a variant headed for a variable-mode slot in place
behind its tag, and anything else into a temporary it then converts. The
inliner keeps the `InlineBlock` of a trivial body whose ADT result changes
mode for this, as it does for a decayed reference. A multi-value call
forwarded by `return` or `return from`, whose values the checker fits to the
function's return types one by one, delivers each value of another type into
a temporary of the callee's type, converted from there into the return
channel (`GenForward`), except a variable-size or resizable variant, which
builds in the channel behind its variable-mode ADT's tag, as `GenAdtAdapted`
builds one (`VariantBehindTag`).

**Named results** (`DetectNrvo`, `OpenIbNrvo`): when every `return` of a
nonfixed result hands back the same top-level local (`NamedResult`), that
local is allocated at the return destination from its declaration and the
return writes only the count; a resizable local returned as a variable array
reserves the destination's length prefix ahead of its elements and patches
it at the return (`EmitPrefixPatch`, moving the elements up only when a
varint prefix outgrows its one reserved byte). The same binding is made for
an *inlined* callee's named result reaching a construction context, which is
what keeps §7.3's guarantee for the small builders the optimizer inlines. A
function that is the target of a `return from` binds its named result too:
a value returned to it from below is moved over it at the catch (§6.6).

**Exits** (`ExitStart`, `LandValue`). A `return`, a `break` with a value
and a return leaving an inlined body build their value at the top of the
stack they deliver it to, while the receiver expects it where that top was
when the function, inlined body or loop was entered. An exit taken while a
construction on that stack is under way -- inside an element of a literal
headed there, a `str()` argument, an inlined callee whose named result is
bound there -- would leave that part in front of its value. Codegen counts
the constructions open per stack (`openat`: `GenConstruct` for anything but
a control construct, and an inlined body's named result); an exit that
finds more of them open than its scope was entered with takes the top before
building its value and moves the value down to the scope's top on entry
afterwards, with the stack's top and a frame object's tail base following
it. That entry top is declared where the scope begins, once an exit needs
it (`ScopeTop0`, `DstTop0`). An exit at statement level emits nothing more.

### 6.6 Calls, dispatch, function values, `return from`

`EmitSpecCall` builds the argument list by the convention above, flushes and
reloads the cached tops the callee can reach (`SyncReach`), and checks the
long-distance discriminant afterwards where the callee can propagate one
(`EmitRfCheck`). Tag dispatch (`EmitDispatch`) evaluates every argument once
in source order, snapshots a by-value scrutinee before later arguments run,
and switches on the tag with one call per arm sharing the argument
temporaries and return channels. The arms have no element-run form: a
variable-array result arrives in the arms' layout and is slid out of its
prefix for a run receiver, or re-prefixed once after the switch for a slot of
another length storage. A function value is spliced inline
(`EmitFvCall`): its parameters and locals are ordinary locals of the
enclosing function, which what is declared in its body takes as free
variables like any other. The call is checked against its destination and
the body's value without one, so the two can be different array or slice
types: an array where a slice is expected (spec §3.10), any array or slice
constructing an array of another kind (spec §4.2). The body then builds its
value as its own type in a temporary, which is sliced whole or copied as the
type the destination names, the call's where it names none; the call's value
is a copy (spec §4.1), so such a slice never points into a variable the body
names. An `extern fn` is a direct C call with prototypes emitted for
symbols the runtime does not define.

**The foreign boundary.** `CheckExternSpec` admits scalars and flat
fixed-size values by value, including fixed-mode ADTs and limited arrays
of static capacity. Parameters additionally admit plain non-optional
references and slices of those values, and `u8[>..]&` builders. Results
are at most one by-value scalar or flat fixed-size value: references,
slices and builders cannot be returned by an extern. A builder argument
uses `gs_rref { hdr, stk }`; C may append through `gs_bld_append` but may
not shrink it, retain borrowed arguments beyond the call, or invalidate
Goose's types, roots or lengths. These are obligations on C, not proofs
the Goose compiler performs. Effect analysis assumes C may write passed
storage and append to passed builders, but does not mutate unrelated
Goose globals. The builtin runtime shims obey the same boundary.

`return ... from` uses one thread-local `int32_t gs_rf` (zero except between
a long-distance return and its catch) plus per-target thread-local channels
for in-flight fixed values (`gs_lret_<id>_<i>`) and destination stacks for
nonfixed ones (`gs_fdst_<id>_<i>`, recorded at the target's entry and
restored at its exit). A propagating function's ordinary exit writes
nothing; a call on a propagation path costs one load and a never-taken
branch, and an intermediate frame returns a dummy value after restoring its
watermarks. `--unsafe-no-rf-check` omits the checks for measurement only.
A nonfixed value is built at its channel's top, which the return records
first (`gs_fval_<id>_<i>`): the calls it unwinds may have built there in
the destination the target handed them -- a named result, part of a value,
a length prefix claimed for a callee's elements -- so the target's catch
moves the value down to its destination's top on entry, as an exit does
(`LandValue`). A call's result is fixed up (`EmitReprefix`,
`EmitSlidePrefix`) only after the check, since a value in flight may lie
behind the prefix the fixup moves.

### 6.7 Relative references, pools, literals

A relative load is the field's own address (or, `in pool`, the pool's base
minus one) plus the stored offset, with a null test only for the optional
spelling (`LoadLoc`, `RelOrigin`); a store subtracts the same origin
(`EmitRelStoreAt`). Whatever produces the value, the store encodes a plain
reference: a branch's or an inlined body's value for a relative slot is
computed into a plain-reference temporary (`CtlValX`), a call's result is
encoded where it lands (`ConstructCall`), and a frame object literal stores
an `in pool` field, a C member of the object, through the same helper
(`GenFrameObjLit`). A local, global or parameter declared with a relative
type is such a slot too: its initializer or argument is encoded into it
(`BindLocal`, `EmitGlobalInit`, `EmitArg`), at varint width on a data stack
as any variable-size value is (`GenConstruct`), and a `var` global without
an initializer starts as `null` (`DefaultValue`). A call's value is plain
too, `default<T>()` of a relative reference being the null pointer, so where
`default<Rel[N]>()` fills its temporary's elements with it, the lvalue store
encodes it (`Call::CgAny`). The store's range check is emitted only
where a root can exceed the width: for `in pool` under
`#if GS_STACK_RESERVE >= 2^bits`, for self-relative under
`#if GS_STACK_RESERVE > 2^(bits-1)` when no fixed-size root in the program
is wider than the width (`relrootmax`), so a `u32` link on the default
256 MB reservation stores unchecked. A pool's base is loaded
once per function into a local (`PoolBase`), and element access through a
pool global reads that local too. `self` stores minus the field's own offset
(self-relative) or the value's own pool offset (`in pool`, only where the
literal is built inside the pool). `pop` on an array of relative references
loads the element it removes like any other load, from the slot it leaves.
`resize(n, ref)` evaluates the fill once as a plain pointer and encodes an
offset at each new slot using the same store helper, including its null and
range checks. Aggregate fills containing self-relative references remain
unsupported.

A `reusable[]` pool's operations (`EmitSlicePool`) evaluate the receiver,
then the slice, then the length (`SliceLen`, which aborts on a negative or
unholdable one), and turn a non-empty slice back into an index: by an exact
divide where the checker placed it in the pool, and otherwise
(`Call::poolcheck`) after testing that it lies inside the element region on an
element boundary, in `uintptr_t` arithmetic so that a slice of other storage
compares without undefined pointer arithmetic, aborting with `GS_E_POOLSLICE`.
An empty slice takes index 0. The freelist is the runtime's (§7): its base, count and top go to the
`gs_spans_*` call by address, so a cached top works unchanged. Growth of the
element region is emitted here (`EmitSliceExtend`: count and top, as for a
push), and so are the default values (`EmitDefaultElems`: one `memset`, or
the checked default construction per element for a type with field defaults). A move is one
`memmove`. A pool's freelist entry is 8 bytes for a slot pool and 16 for a
slice pool (`FlEntrySize`), which the thread-spawn image copies.

A fixed struct or array literal that holds relative references is built at
its final address, never in a C temporary that is then copied (`FixedLitAt`,
`FixedLitAtStk`, the `alloc_ref` slot path); a literal with unused limited
array slots is zero-initialized first, and every aggregate-typed C local is
hoisted to the function's opening brace (`HoistAggregateDecls`) -- both
workarounds for MSVC miscompilations described in Appendix E. A zero-length
array's literal is zero-initialized too (`HasUninitSlots`): nothing writes the
one slot its C struct has, and copying a C object nothing wrote is undefined.
For the same reason a struct or variant literal without fields zeroes its C
object (`StructLitAt`), its `gs_empty` byte or its pads.

### 6.8 Threads and queues

`thread_spawn` packs the flat arguments contiguously on a scratch stack, then
the worker program's globals as `[size][image]` records (a resizable's image
is its count, its fixed fields and its tail's elements; a pool's carries its
freelist), and hands the packet to the runtime; the generated thunk
(`EnsureThreadThunk`) unpacks the arguments onto fresh stacks, allocates the
worker's `gs_globals_t`, fills it from the image, runs the body, and frees
it. Queues are one `gs_queue` per element type, which `main` creates
(`gs_qinit`) before anything else runs, carrying one contiguous image per
value; a missed `qpoll` yields the all-zero image (`ZeroSize`). A value
of no bytes (spec §3.4) crosses a queue or a thread's arguments as none, and
the receiver zeroes the object C gives it rather than reading past the image.

### 6.9 Generated walkers

Per type on demand: `gs_size_<T>` (the byte size of a dynamic value),
`gs_eq_<T>` (structural equality, a `memcmp` for gap-free fixed types and
canonical-encoding bytes values that hold no floats, a cursor walk
otherwise), `gs_verify_<T>` (the `from_bytes` verifier of
`docs/design/serialization.md`: one framing pass for fixed elements, a
framing pass setting an element-start bitmap and a link pass for variable
ones), and the tag enums. Text rendering (`codegen_render.h`) formats
scalars through `gs_fmt_*`, copies `u8` bytes, and renders everything else
structurally into a `u8[>..]` builder or through the user `format`
specialization recorded on the call; `print` renders the whole line into a
temporary builder before writing it, so lines from different threads never
interleave. A struct, variant or ADT met again inside its own rendering --
a type that reaches itself through references or slices -- is rendered from
there by `gs_render_<T>`, one per type (`RenderFn`), which takes the
builder and a reference to the value as an overload taking it by
reference does, and calls itself, or the functions of the other types of a
mutual recursion, for each level below; no overload renders a part of such
a type (§3.7), so none of it depends on the call. A resizable tail with no
header of its own is rendered in place one level more, up to the reference
to the next.

**Serialization contract.** The following is the observable part of
`docs/design/serialization.md`, independent of how a verifier is organized:

* `to_bytes(a)` emits `ULEB128(payload byte count)` followed by the
  contiguous element region of the source array or slice. It excludes the
  source's outer length/capacity/header and any reusable-pool freelist;
  metadata within each element remains. The two-argument form appends the
  same image. `bytes_of(a)` views just that payload, read-only, with the
  source's lifetime; its length is fixed when the view is taken.
* The image carries no type, element count, version or checksum. Both
  endpoints must agree on the element type and its layout. Plain
  references, slices and pool-relative links at any depth exclude an
  element type from all three operations. Saving a subrange does not make
  self-relative links to excluded elements self-contained.
* `from_bytes<A>(b)` consumes exactly one image: the prefix must account
  for all remaining bytes, with neither truncation nor trailing data.
  The element count is recovered from the payload. `A` may be a grow-only,
  grow-shrink or variable array. Invalid input yields an empty `A` and
  `false`; success copies into independently owned storage and yields
  `true`. It does not retain a view of the input.
* Validation must establish every representation invariant used by
  ordinary reads: bounded lengths, complete elements, valid tags and
  booleans, and valid varints. Varints constructed by Goose use the
  shortest encoding; equality currently relies on that canonical form.
  Limited-array live lengths cannot exceed capacity; unused slots and
  padding carry no typed values to validate. Untrusted offsets and size
  arithmetic must be checked without overflowing before accessing data.
* Every non-null self-relative link must land on an outer element start,
  or on the payload of the correctly tagged variant of that element.
  Interior-field targets are rejected at typecheck time, even if a
  particular image would be valid. A zero offset is null only for an
  optional; a non-optional zero offset still denotes its field address.
  Boolean bytes and varints are checked for canonical encodings, including
  within nested aggregates and array metadata.
* The current variable-element link verifier uses at most one reservation
  of scratch for its start bitmap; an image needing more is rejected with
  `false`. Elements that can occupy zero bytes have no recoverable count:
  the current verifier accepts only an empty payload, as zero elements.
  Ordinary allocation failure remains a runtime failure. Serialization
  on a big-endian host aborts.

**Text compatibility.** Aggregate separators are `, `; struct and payload
forms use `Type { ` and ` }`, without field labels. Nested byte strings
escape quote, backslash, newline, carriage return and tab, while other
bytes remain literal; top-level byte strings are unquoted. Values are
rendered in argument order, so an argument's rendering hook runs before
the next argument is evaluated. Hook discovery currently accepts only
top-level, non-generic two-parameter `format` functions with a
`u8[>..]&` destination and an exact value or plain-reference parameter for
the rendered type. This is narrower than ordinary generic overload
resolution. Reference rendering follows pointees and has no cycle
detection: a cyclic value recurses through its render functions until the
native stack runs out (§7, **Native stacks**). Finite float formatting
currently tries 15 significant decimal digits, then 17 if needed to recover
the `f64`, with redundant exponent zeroes removed to at least two
digits (`gs_fmt_f64`). That is a round-trip format, not a general
shortest-decimal algorithm; see section 11. An `f32` takes the fewest of 6
to 9 digits that read back as the same `f32` (`gs_fmt_f32`), through
`strtod` and a cast on every backend, and is laid out as the text of the
`f64` nearest those digits, so `f32` and `f64` text share one style. A
whole number gets `.0` (`1.0`, `2147483600.0`), as does the compiler's own
text of a double (`CatOne`), which C float literals and dumps use. Infinities and NaNs are
spelled by the runtime (`inf`, `-inf`, `nan`) rather than by the C
library, which differs between backends: msvcrt, linked by TinyCC on
Windows, writes `1.#INF` and `-1.#IND`, and others print a NaN's sign.

### 6.10 Loop-invariant views and stack-top caching

**Views.** An array reached through a reference keeps its base and length
behind that reference, and the C backend reloads both at every access since
any byte store may alias the header. For each reference variable BCE named
in a loop's `hoistrefs`, the view is read into locals before the loop
(`AddView`, `ViewScope`) and every access inside uses them; the length
lvalue that growth writes stays on the real header, so a missed growth could
never miscompile. For a `for` over an array with `fixedlen`, the elements
pointer and length are likewise read once when the length is a memory load.

**Tops.** A stack the function owns keeps its top in a local where the
function grows it, synchronized with memory only where something else can
observe it: flushed before and reloaded after calls that can reach the stack
(`SyncReach`: the argument text plus the callee's reachable globals; "*" for
a callee handed an opaque stack inside a value), and flushed at every exit.
The local is confined to the loops that grow the stack (`PlanTopCaches`), or
the whole body for growth outside every loop, and is materialized by a text
pass over the finished body that resolves markers for loop edges, syncs, and
jumps out of a region (`ExpandTopMarkers`). Soundness needs one spelling per
cached stack: a body holding a fat reference in any variable, binding,
field read or call result has a second spelling for a stack it may also name
directly and caches nothing (`CanCacheTops`) -- unless it qualifies for the
**reference-parameter mode** (`RefTopsOk`): every fat reference in the body
is a parameter named directly, the fat parameters' root classes are distinct
and exact (and concrete when there are several), no by-value resizable
parameter, no nonfixed return destination, no `return from` channel, no
captured resizable, and no global whose type could be one of those
parameters' pointees. In that mode the parameters' `.stk` tops are cached
instead, and every call syncs everything.

---

## 7. The runtime

The runtime is a small C99 one covering data stacks, integer semantics,
varints, aborts, text forms, workers and queues, and the C behind
`stdlib/os.goose`. It comes in two halves. `src/runtime/runtime.h` is what a
program's own translation unit needs: configuration, macros, the helpers that
must inline (integer operations, checks, varints, slice pool spans), the data
stack state the emitted code reads (`gs_stks`, `gs_gl`) with the few
functions that touch it, and declarations of everything else;
`runtime_ext.h`, spliced in after the generated types because it is written
against them, adds the extern support an `--include` header may use
(`gs_bld_append`) and declares the `gs_os_*` functions. The other half,
`runtime_impl.h`, `runtime_threads.h` and `runtime_os.h`, defines what they
declare, and is the only part that includes the platform's headers.

How the halves meet is the driver's choice (`main.cpp`). The C that `-o`
writes defines `GS_SEPARATE_RUNTIME` and holds the first half only, the
functions it declares being extern; `goose --emit-runtime` writes the second
half, with the first for its declarations, as a C file of its own
(`GS_RUNTIME_OBJECT`), which is compiled once and linked with every program.
That object serves every program the compiler writes, whatever its
configuration: it always supports workers (`GS_NEED_THREADS`, which
otherwise only the program's own state follows), holds the failure paths of
debug and release builds alike, and takes the data stack sizes and
`GS_MAX_STACKS` from the program as it starts (`gs_rt_start`, called by the
program's `gs_rt_init`) rather than from macros. What a program and its
runtime object do have to agree on is the runtime itself: both define
`GS_RUNTIME_VERSION`, a hash of the runtime's text, which renames
`gs_rt_start`, so a program written by another version of the compiler fails
to link. `--standalone` writes all of it into one unit, everything the
runtime defines static, and that is the form a JIT run compiles: TinyCC
builds one unit in memory, and could not place the runtime object's
thread-local storage there. With the platform's headers (`windows.h` above
all) and the runtime's own functions out of the program's unit, MSVC
compiles a test program about 60 ms faster (a third of a small one's compile
alone; the link, about 95 ms, is the same either way), and the programs run
as fast: what the runtime object holds is the failure paths, printing, the
OS layer and region reservation, none of it on a hot path, and every
function a failing check calls is declared not to return, which is what the
C compiler needs to keep a check's path short.

**Data stacks.** Each stack is one reserved region of `GS_STACK_RESERVE`
bytes (default 256 MB, capped at 2^48 by §10.4) plus a `GS_STACK_GAP`
unmapped tail, sizes the program's configuration sets and hands to the
runtime as it starts; Windows commits on fault through a vectored handler that
tells a commit from an overrun, POSIX reserves with overcommit and protects
the gap. A thread program's stacks live in a block reached through
thread-local `gs_stks` and are created lazily as `GS_ENSURE`, in a function's
prologue, first asks for them (past `GS_MAX_STACKS` it aborts, naming the
function's declaration); a worker's are released when it exits. Every region
owned by the current thread program is registered thread-locally so the fault
handler never touches another worker's state: a registry of `4 *
GS_MAX_STACKS` regions, which the runtime allocates as the thread program
starts and frees with its regions.

**Native stacks.** Recursion consumes only the native call stack (spec
§7.8), whose size is set as its thread starts; running out of it ends the
program with `goose runtime error: native call stack overflow` and exit
status 1, as a data stack overrun does. Every thread program's thread
prepares for that as it starts (`gs_native_stack_init`, from `gs_rt_start`
and `gs_thread_main`). On Windows the vectored handler takes
`EXCEPTION_STACK_OVERFLOW`, and `SetThreadStackGuarantee` keeps 64 KB of
each such stack for it: what an overflow leaves without one only just holds
the report and `ExitProcess`. A program TinyCC builds looks the function up,
its `kernel32.def` lacking it. On POSIX the handler runs on an alternate
signal stack, which the runtime allocates for each such thread unless it has
one already (ASan gives every thread its own) and releases with a worker's
data stacks. A fault between 64 KB below the thread's stack and its top is
that stack overflowing, by the bounds read as the thread starts
(`pthread_getattr_np` on Linux, `pthread_get_stackaddr_np` and
`pthread_get_stacksize_np` on macOS; elsewhere there are none, and the
overflow is not reported). A fault that is neither kind gets back the
handler the runtime replaced and recurs under it: the default action, or a
sanitizer's report. A JIT program installs all this on the compiler's main
thread, which it runs on (§1).

**Integer semantics** (§6.2): every operation runs at its type through
`gs_add_i32`-style helpers, which are functions that check the wide result
under `GS_DEBUG` and macros equal to the release expression otherwise
(measured at 13--37% of runtime under a non-inlining backend when they were
functions); division and modulo are always functions, zero-checked, with
Euclidean `%`. `as` goes through `GS_RANGE`/`GS_F2I`/... macros that check in
debug and cast in release, except to a float, and from an integer type whose
every value the target holds, which are plain C casts in every build; `as!`
and release float-to-int use the defined wrap of `gs_f2iwrap`. A signed type's
add, sub, mul and neg helper and every checked cast also take the file and
line of the operation, and a debug check that fails prints them with the
operands or the value and the type. The release macros drop them unevaluated,
so release builds compile to the code they would without them; the arguments
cost about 1% of the generated C, and no measurable TinyCC compile time.
Bounds checks are one unsigned compare (`GS_IDX`).

**Slice pools** (§5.4): the `gs_spans_*` functions keep a `reusable[]`
pool's freelist, a sorted run of `gs_span { idx, cnt }` on the freelist's own
stack, handed its base, span count and stack top (the address of a cached top
works as well as the memory form). Placing a run (`gs_spans_alloc`, for
`alloc_slice` and for a slice `realloc_slice` moves) scans the spans in
index order for the first that holds it, falling back to the end of the
array, where a free span reaching it starts the run; growth in place and
freeing find their neighbor by binary
search (`gs_spans_grow`, `gs_spans_free`), and inserting or removing a span
moves the entries above it. The emitted code keeps the element region's
count and top and fills the default values itself.

**The graphics layer** behind `stdlib/gfx.goose` is not part of this runtime:
it is native C in `src/gfx/`, compiled once into a static library over SDL3
that `goose` links for JIT runs and a program links when built from the
generated C. The generated C only declares the `gs_gfx_*` functions it calls,
and `AddGfxSymbols` (`jit.h`) defines them for a JIT run. `docs/design/gfx.md`
describes it. **The physics layer** behind `stdlib/physics.goose` is built
the same way over Box3D, in `src/physics/`, its functions `gs_phys_*` and
their JIT definitions `AddPhysicsSymbols`; `docs/design/physics.md`
describes it. **The ui layer** behind `stdlib/ui.goose` is built the same
way over Nuklear, in `src/ui/`, its functions `gs_ui_*` and their JIT
definitions `AddUiSymbols`; `docs/design/ui.md` describes it. **The sqlite
layer** behind `stdlib/sqlite.goose` is built the same way over the SQLite
amalgamation vendored in `third_party/sqlite`, in `src/sqlite/`, its
functions `gs_sql_*` and their JIT definitions `AddSqliteSymbols`;
`docs/design/sqlite.md` describes it. Unlike the others it may be called
from a `thread_fn`, so `gs_sql_` is not among the prefixes the thread check
rejects. Codegen notes which of the layers a program calls in `NativeLayers`
(`utils.h`), by symbol prefix, for the JIT run to register.

**Varints**: ULEB128 read/write/size, zigzag for signed positions, the
one-byte fast path macros `GS_ULEB_READ`/`GS_ULEB_SIZE` for length prefixes
(a value field keeps the inline loop, which measured faster), and the bounded
`gs_uleb_check`/`gs_zig_check` the verifier uses.

## 8. Testing the analyses

`docs/testing.md` describes the test suite. The following checks cover the
passes described above:

* every positive fixture typechecks, and its dump reparses to the same dump;
* `test/errors_tc/` fixtures carry `// error: <substring>` markers and must
  fail with those diagnostics: this is where the lifetime, shrink,
  construction-growth, cycle, writability and relative-reference rules are
  pinned;
* `test/lifetimes/`, `test/storage/` and `test/codegen/` run the positive
  side of the same rules, including the store record, byte views, pool
  links, named results and the stack-top aliasing cases;
* `// bce:elide` / `// bce:keep` fixtures verify the bounds-check pass
  line by line, and run as programs;
* `test/optimizer/optimize.goose` inspects `--specs` to check which recursive
  bodies became loops and which kept their calls;
* the JIT backend runs everything a second way, and a sanitizer job runs the
  generated C under ASan/UBSan.

---

## 9. Writing fast Goose

This section explains how compiler analysis, copy elimination, and caching
affect performance. Each recommendation refers to the relevant mechanism;
`bench/notes.md` and `bench/adoption.md` provide measurements.

### 9.1 Bounds checks

The analysis of §5 proves an index or slice check when it can relate the
index to the array's length through facts it saw *in this function or at its
call sites*. In practice:

**Proven** (no check emitted):

* constant indices into fixed arrays, and any index into a fixed array whose
  range a condition established (`if k >= 0 && k < 4 { a[k] }`, a `match`
  arm `0..4 => a[k]`);
* `for i in a.len { a[i] }`, `for x, i in a { a[i] }`, `while i < a.len {
  a[i]; i++; }`, and the downward `while d > 0 { d--; a[d]; }` -- the loop
  variable's `>= 0` and `<= len` invariants are inferred for a local counter
  whose every write is an assignment of a provable value or `++`/`--`/`+=
  c`/`-= c` that cannot wrap;
* the same loops over an array that the body *grows*: a `push` never lowers a
  bound (`grow_during_loop` in `test/optimizer/bce.goose`);
* an array filled by a counted loop and then indexed by the same count:
  `for i in n { a.push(...) }` states `a.len == n` afterwards, when no other
  statement in that loop touches `a` and no `break`/`continue` skips an
  iteration;
* `s[s.len - 1]` after `guard s.len > 0`, `s[k]` after `assert(k >= 0);
  assert(k < s.len);` or an early-out `if k < 0 || k >= s.len { return }`;
* reductions: `a[k % a.len]` once `a.len > 0` is known (a `guard`, or the
  loop that filled `a`), `a[k % -4]` against a length above 3, and
  `a[(h & 63) as! i64]` into 64 elements -- a mask bounds its result when it
  is provably non-negative, so `let mask = a.len - 1` also needs `a.len >= 1`
  known; a symbolic negation as divisor (`k % (0 - n)`) is not expressible;
  a `u64` hash reduced with `%` or `&` and cast to `i64` carries its range
  through the cast;
* row-major indexing with bounded counters: `src[y * W + x]` for `y < H`,
  `x < W` and `src.len == W * H` (products and two-term sums of counters with
  constant bounds), and the row-slice form `let row = src[lo..lo + W]` whose
  length the slice's bounds state, so `row[x]` needs no assert;
* checks inside a function called with arrays whose lengths every caller
  knows: `fn blur(src: u8[>..]&, dst: u8[>..]&)` enters with `src.len ==
  W * W` when each call site established it, provided every call site is
  an ordinary call (not a thread entry, not a `format` overload reached by
  `print`) and none is inside a recursive cycle;
* checks after a call to a function that only reads and writes elements:
  the callee's effect summary says it resizes nothing, so the caller's
  length facts survive.

**Kept** (the check stays, and is usually a well-predicted branch):

* an index loaded from a data structure -- `dist[q[i]]`, `pool[slots[k].node]`,
  `out[cursor[s]]`: the analysis tracks no array contents;
* a `u64`-typed index variable (a `u64` is never a base), an index read out
  of a field or element (`n.count`, only variables and lengths are bases),
  and any value that reaches the index through a cast the facts cannot prove
  in range;
* an index whose relation to the length crosses a `pop`, `resize`, `clear`,
  whole assignment, or a call the summary says may resize that array (or a
  call with no summary at all: a thread spawn, a call through an opaque
  site);
* a comparison against a value computed by a call that mutates tracked state
  inside the condition itself;
* an index that is `var + c` at a width narrower than `i64`, and a condition
  whose side is `var + c` (only a bare variable, a constant, or a length plus
  a small constant is admitted as a comparison side, since the addition
  itself may have wrapped before the compare);
* a loop exit condition that is a disjunction (`while i < n && ok`), whose
  negation the domain cannot state.

Practical consequences: state facts with `assert` where the compiler cannot
see them (`assert(a.len == n)` at a function's entry when its callers are
opaque); keep indices in `i64` locals derived from counters and lengths
rather than `u64` or loaded values; write image and matrix kernels either as
row slices or as `y * W + x` against a length the caller states; and check
with `--bce-lines` which lines kept their checks. On MSVC a kept check inside
a hot loop prevents vectorization outright (`blur` is 1.75x slower with its
nine checks); on clang the checks cost little and the loop-view hoist below
is what matters.

### 9.2 Arrays behind references

An array reached through a reference or slice keeps its base and length in
memory the C compiler must reload after every byte store. Two things remove
the reloads:

* **View hoisting**: in a loop that only reads and writes *elements* of the
  array behind a reference variable -- no `push`, `pop`, `resize`, `clear`,
  whole assignment, rebind, or call that can reach it -- the view is read
  once before the loop. This gives a 4x speedup on `blur` under clang. A loop that
  grows the array cannot have it; move growth out of the read loop, or split
  the loop.
* **Stack-top caching**: pushes through a fat reference parameter run with
  the top in a register when the function qualifies (§6.10): every fat
  reference in the body is a parameter, the parameters are provably distinct
  arrays at every call site (exact roots), the function returns nothing
  nonfixed, has no `return from` channel, captures no resizable, and names
  no global that could be one of the parameters' pointees. A function that
  also reads a fat reference out of a field, or holds one in a local, keeps
  the memory form for every stack. For helpers that push frequently, pass
  distinct pools as parameters to enable this optimization.

A function caches the stack tops of arrays it owns where it grows them.
When growth occurs only inside a loop, the cache is confined to that loop.
A loop that only updates elements therefore needs no register for a cached top.

### 9.3 Construction and copies

* A nonfixed value is built at its destination (§4.3): `let x = f()`,
  `v.push(f())`, `v.append(f())`, `g(f())`, `x = f()` and a struct field
  initializer all hand the callee their stack. A `return` of a named local
  costs nothing when every return hands back that one local (`DetectNrvo`),
  including after the optimizer inlines the callee. Returning different
  locals on different paths copies all but one; a multi-name receive (`let
  a, b = f(); return a;`) copies.
* `v.append(f())` for a `T[]`-returning `f` compiles a second copy of `f` in
  element-run form; a builtin or dispatch result there costs one `memmove`
  of the elements over the prefix. A `T[..]` result is built on a temporary
  and costs one copy of its elements.
* A fixed-size element pushed into an array is evaluated first and stored
  after, so `v.push(f(v))` may grow `v` inside `f`. A variable-size element,
  or one holding relative references, is built in its slot, and `f` may then
  not grow `v` -- nor may a callee grow the array a `v.append(f())` or a
  whole assignment `v = f()` is building into (§4.2): a compile error, with
  the callee's growths of its parameters, globals and captures counted.
  The elements of an appended literal, `v.append([f(v), x])`, follow the
  same rule as pushed ones. A whole assignment's `f` may not use `v` at all
  (§4.4); new contents computed from the old are built in a local of their
  own and assigned as its `copy()`, one copy.
* An array or slice of another kind meeting a `T[..k]` -- a local, an
  argument, a field, an assignment, a return -- is an O(length) copy into
  the C value after a capacity check, whatever the source's representation.
* `copy(x)` is a real O(size) copy, and so is any assignment of a non-fixed
  lvalue; the checker forces the spelling so the cost is visible.
* A function returning several values is never inlined. At `-O1` and above,
  a single use or a small body qualifies a function for inlining (thresholds
  of 8 nodes at `-O1`, 16 at `-O2`), subject to the eligibility rules and
  nesting limit in section 4.
* `str(...)` and `format(out, ...)` write straight at the destination's stack
  top; `print` renders into a temporary builder first. Structural rendering
  of aggregates calls a generated walker per type.
* A fixed-size struct literal is a C temporary copied to its destination,
  except one holding relative references, which is built in place.

### 9.4 Integer types

* Arithmetic runs at the operands' width (§6.2): a sum of `u8` taps wraps at
  8 bits; widen each operand (`as u16`) before summing.
* `varint` costs a decode per read; use it for values with a wide or
  unpredictable range and a sized integer for values whose range is known
  (`calc` lost 11% to `varint` numbers that fit a `u8`). Length prefixes decode
  with a one-byte fast path; value fields do not.
* A `u64` local drops out of every bounds proof; compare `u64` hashes with
  `.len`-derived values directly (§6.1 admits it) and reduce with `%` or `&`
  before binding the result to an `i64`.
* `let` bindings of `.len`, `.cap` or literals keep the non-negativity that
  the `u64` comparison rule needs; `var` bindings lose it.
* A literal argument to a generic or untyped parameter is a literal parameter
  adapting to every use in the body; negative literals can adapt to narrower
  types too, provided they fit every recorded use.

### 9.5 Relative references and pools

* Self-relative links (`T&<u32>`) cost nothing measurable against indices on
  structures built once and walked; on a structure that *relinks* (an LRU
  list) each store subtracts the field's own address and each load adds to
  it before the next load can issue, which measured 1.5x against indices.
* `in pool` links (`T&<u32 in pool>`) store as a subtraction from a base held
  in a register and load as `base + off`, let other arrays hold 4-byte links
  into the pool, and copy freely; they are the form for relink-heavy
  structures in a global pool. clang schedules the base-plus-offset load
  better than MSVC.
* An optional link pays a null test per load; a sentinel-terminated
  structure with non-optional links initialized through `self` loads as a
  plain add (`lru_nonopt`: 1.10x under MSVC).
* The store-time range check is gone for `u32` links at the default
  reservation and for any width the reservation cannot exceed; `u16` links
  keep it.
* A structure whose links stay within one root array has no rebasing cost
  when moved or serialized; `bytes_of` is a zero-copy view of it.
* A plain reference parameter outside a recursive cycle has its own root
  class and cannot be stored as a relative link into the pool it came from;
  inside a `recursive` cycle the pool-class analysis identifies it. Helpers
  that link nodes want to live in the cycle, take the pool itself, or use
  `in pool` links (whose root is the named global whatever the parameter's
  class).

### 9.6 Recursion and dispatch

* A `recursive fn` whose body starts with the base case `if c { return e; }`
  has that base case inlined at every self-call (`-O1` and above), halving
  the calls of a complete tree walk; a statement before the test, a UFCS
  self-call, or mutual recursion disables it, and a self-call whose array
  result a slice destination takes whole stays a call.
* A self-recursive integer function whose tail returns fold with one
  associative operator becomes a loop; `1 + f(l) + f(r)` loses its right
  spine. Floats, `%`, returns inside nested loops, and callees that can
  `return from` the function disable it.
* Cycle members are never inlined and nothing is inlined into them.
* Case-function dispatch is one `switch` with a direct call per arm, the
  arms inlinable like any call; `match` is the same `switch` in place.
* `return ... from` costs a thread-local write at the return, a load and
  never-taken branch after every call on a propagation path, and nothing on
  an ordinary return.

### 9.7 Scratch, shrinking, and lifetimes

* A grow-only array can be `clear`ed, `pop`ped or `resize`d wherever the
  checker can see that no reference or slice into it is live afterwards
  (§3.10): use a view for the last time, then shrink; a shrink is a
  statement of its own, not part of a larger expression.
* Scope exit releases storage by restoring a stack watermark. A scratch
  buffer declared inside a loop is reset this way at the end of each
  iteration, without per-element cleanup. In a recursive function, one
  declared in a block that ends before the recursive call reuses the same
  data stack at every level (§7.8).
* `reusable` pools cost nothing per operation beyond the freelist push and
  pop; `free(i)` bounds-checks its index.
* A `reusable[]` pool's `alloc_slice` scans the free spans in index order up
  to the first that holds the request. Adding or removing a span (a free
  that merges with neither neighbor or with both, an allocation that uses a
  span up) moves the spans above it. Both costs grow with the number of free
  spans, of which merging leaves at most one more than there are allocated
  runs between them. A slice handed back costs a range test unless the checker placed it in the pool, and
  new elements cost one `memset` unless the element type has field
  defaults.
* A `realloc_slice` that cannot grow in place scans for space and copies
  the slice. The copy lands at the front of the span it takes, so what is
  left of that span is room to grow into; once none is, a slice grown an
  element at a time is copied at every growth, and growing by a factor keeps
  the copies amortized.
* A thread program copies every global it uses at spawn; keep a worker's
  globals small or pass what it needs as arguments.

### 9.8 Backends

The generated C is the same for every backend; the differences measured in
`bench/notes.md` are the backends'. clang vectorizes checked loops and
schedules base-plus-offset loads; MSVC does neither, and is better at
recursion into a bump allocator. `bench/results.md` reports every row under
both, and the JIT backend (TinyCC) is for running without a toolchain, not
for speed.

---

## 10. Where the compiler is more conservative than the specification

Rules the current implementation applies beyond, or in place of, what the
specification allows, and the shapes the C backend refuses outright:

* A long-distance return may carry only references rooted at globals or
  static data (TODO 0d).
* Inside a recursive cycle, a reference rooted at a caller's fixed-size local
  is pass-down only unless the parameter it came through is threaded (§3.11);
  the spec's cycle store rule is stated the same way and marked for
  refinement (TODO 5). Beyond the spec's rule, a merged value or a rebound
  variable that may be rooted at a threaded class, which the spec stores
  where each of its roots could be, is pass-down only.
* A back edge that passes storage of its own to a reference, slice or
  holder parameter the entry call gave static data gets a holder result
  that may only be passed down: the body was checked with that parameter
  as static data, which no record can map to what the back edge passes
  (§3.11).
* A plain reference parameter's root class is identified with a global pool
  only inside a recursive cycle or through the `in pool` form (§9.5 above,
  `bench/notes.md` item 1), so `index_of`, a relative store and an exact
  read-back through such a parameter need a pool some `T&<w in pool>` type
  names. Recording in the specialization key which global every exactly
  rooted reference argument points into, rather than only those, would lift
  that, at the cost of one specialization per distinct global passed.
* Bounds-check elimination tracks no array contents and no `u64` variables
  (§5.12).
* A slice loaded through a reference-to-slice parameter is a class of its
  own only where the body reaches the argument's slot through references
  alone (§3.4). Behind a parameter given a field or an element (a `format`
  overload's, given a part of what print, str or format renders), a slice
  variable the callee can name -- a global's, or one a nested function or a
  function value handed to it sees -- or a caller's parameter class without
  such a class, and in a `recursive fn`, it is only bounded by the caller's
  slot (`SlotView`): what the callee returns of it may point into anything
  the slot outlives, so a nested cursor helper's token (`take(cur, 5)` with
  `fn take(p: u8[:]&, n: i64) -> u8[:]` declared where `cur` is) cannot be
  returned past the function owning `cur`, and a callee shrinking an array
  at the slot's depth or outside while such a slice is still used is an
  error in the callee, whatever its call sites pass. Where the slot is a
  slice variable's own, what the callee stores of that slice is bounded by
  the variable too, not traced to its binding (§3.5). Where the slice is a
  class of its own, a store that may write the slot through another class
  or a bound joins it, whatever slot the call sites give that class, and a
  store in a nested body leaves it bounded by the slot there.
* A shrink of a grow-only array takes a slice slot a reference names -- a
  slice variable, or the caller's slot a parameter's class stands for,
  which for a reference variable excepts a class with a class of its own
  for its slice -- to hold a view of every array at the slot's depth or
  outside it (§3.10, item 4), whether a variable holds the reference or a
  holder does: `R { r: s }` still used after a clear of an array declared
  beside `s` is an error even where `s` views another array. Judging a
  slice variable by its bindings, which a store through a reference to it
  rebinds too (§3.5), as the §5.2 scan does, and a holder's class with a
  class for its slice as a reference variable's, with the pairs its
  callers judge (`NoteLiveViews`), would narrow it.
* A shrink of a grow-only array leaves what the caller's array a slice
  parameter views the elements of holds, and what the holder a reference
  parameter names holds, to each call, which judges it by its record of
  the argument's storage (§3.10, **Parameters' views**), whether the
  callee reads it through the parameter, a holder it stored the parameter
  into or, where its contents are one array, a by-value holder parameter,
  and so are a view read out of that storage before the shrink, a holder
  of the activation's keeping one or copied out of that storage, a merge of
  such copies, a literal holding one, a call's result that is one, each
  also where a variable holds it, and a view read out of such a holder
  before the shrink, in a loop too (**Class reads**):
  every store on record there counts, one the callee makes after its
  shrink or into another element too, and a slice of a call's result,
  whose elements nothing records, holds anything. Such a view is still
  taken to point anywhere at the parameter's class depth or outside it
  where a `var` holds it, where a merge or a rebind joins it with anything
  else rooted at the class, where it was read out of a view itself read out
  of the storage (`wss[0][0]`), and where a call returns one it read out of
  what an argument views that is no class of the caller's; so is a holder
  copied out of the storage where it may lie in several storages (`for h in
  if c { a } else { b }`), in a view read out of the storage (`for h in
  hss[0]`) or in what a by-value holder parameter views (`p.hs[0]`), and a
  merge, a literal or a call's result joining such a copy with anything
  else rooted at the class (`Q { h: ns[1], at: ns[0] }`); and a view read
  out of such a holder where anything else was stored there, and where a
  `for` loop binds it (`for w in ws`, `ws` filled with views out of the
  storage); and so are what a `var` parameter's elements hold while the
  parameter is still used, what
  a by-value holder parameter's class holds where its contents are not one
  array exactly (`RootArg::heldexact`, never set in a `recursive fn`;
  `emit(buf, P { words: ["x", "y"] })` views a literal, a temporary no
  argument names exactly), and what a slot without a class of its own for
  its slice holds: `fn emit(out: u8[>..]&, hss: (H[:])[:])` running `for
  h in hss[0] { out.clear(); out.append(h.s); }` is an error in the callee
  wherever a call site passes `hss` from `out`'s scope or a deeper one,
  where the same loop over the holders `hs: H[:]` views is judged at each
  call.
* A parameter is a slot read (§3.10) only where its argument has a root, or
  a holder's contents one, that holds a grow-shrink array (§3.4): the key
  records the bit only there, so that a function given no such argument is
  never specialized twice for it. Elsewhere the class holds no such array
  for the store rule to find, but a holder parameter's contents only bound
  what it holds, and a grow-shrink shrink in the body still counts a holder
  parameter passed on in the same statement where that bound is as deep as
  the array. A call's result takes the bit from a return through a
  parameter's class only where the argument for it has the bit too
  (`RetAltVal`), so a holder read out of a parameter's array and returned,
  `fn f(rs: Row[>..<]&) -> Row { rs[0] }`, is no slot read at the call.
* A holder loaded whole through a reference (`DecayRef`) has its contents
  bounded by the reference's roots, which may name the grow-shrink array
  whose element the reference points at: stored, it fails the store rule as
  a reference into that array would, though what it holds lies in the
  element's fields. A field of it read through the reference, or a match
  binder's copy of its payload, is a slot read.
* An argument whose root only bounds it, and which may point into or holds
  a grow-shrink array in what that root leads to, gives its class a
  grow-shrink array that is not its root's own (`RootArg::gsvia`), taken to
  hold anything: a whole grow-shrink array that a call returned
  (`keep(arr_of(t))`) may not be stored by the callee as a reference to the
  whole array, though the caller may store it, and one loaded out of a slot
  (`keep(t.a)`) may. A value that merges a byte view no slot held with a
  root that only bounds it counts every grow-shrink array a byte view can
  cover in what that root leads to (§3.5), `Prov::freshview` being the
  value's, not each root's.
* A shrink of an array in what an inexactly rooted reference points at
  (`c.s.arr.pop()`, with `c.s` read out of `c`) counts as a shrink of every
  array of that array's type the root bounds, not only of those in storage
  that can hold what the reference points at, as a store through it does
  (§3.5): the pairs of roots it leaves its callers (`LiveShrink`) and its
  bound summaries (`BoundShrink`) carry the array's type alone, so narrowing
  the shrink by what its path reached would only move the rejection to the
  call.
* A shrink of a global array counts another global as holding a reference
  into it where the store record says it may (§3.10). The record is coarse
  in two places: static data a back edge returns is an inexact root
  (`RetAltVal`), which may be any array its pointee fits, so a global given
  such a result counts wherever it could; and a global holder passed to a
  by-value holder parameter gives it class 0, with no call-site facts for
  the class, so what the callee stores of it counts the same.
* A local holder's `contents` are one set for the whole holder (§3.6): a
  view stored in one of its fields or elements is among what a read out of
  any other may point into, whatever their types. A holder copied out of a
  field or an element has only that container as a bound on what it holds,
  so a read out of the copy takes every candidate, though the container's
  own `contents` may name one array.
* A store through a reference to a slice that may name several slots -- one
  read out of storage, a merge, a parameter given such an argument, or the
  class of a nested function's parameter beside the variables of the frames
  around it -- binds every slice variable it may name (§3.5), each under
  §9.2's depth rule: a view of an array at another depth than one of them is
  bound at is an error there, though the store may never land in it. Every
  global slice variable of the slot's type is among them, a reference to it
  being one a function checked later may make; a local only once one has
  been made. A class of its own for each captured variable a nested
  function's parameter names exactly, in the specialization key, would
  spare those beside it.
* What a callee stores through a reference-to-slice parameter binds the
  caller's variable to what the callee stored as its argument bounds it,
  unless it loaded the slice through another such parameter whose slice's
  elements hold no references (§3.5): a slice read out of a slice of slices
  behind a parameter binds the variable to anything the argument outlives,
  which may then break the depth rule.
* A reference to a slice has one writability for the slot it names and the
  slice the slot holds (§3.8), so one to a slice variable holding a read-only
  slice cannot re-point the variable either: `skip(&cur)` advancing a cursor
  `var cur = text` over a parameter given a literal is rejected, as
  `skip(cur)` is. Nor can one to a slot that is not written -- a by-value
  binder, a field of a `const` value or of one reached through a `const T&`
  -- write the elements of the slice there, which a copy of the slice can:
  `poke(c.f)` writing `p[0]` is rejected, as `poke(&c.f)` is, and
  `let t = c.f; t[0] = 65;` is not. A `format` overload taking a slice by
  reference is given a read-only temporary for one that is no storage
  (**Format overloads**), so it cannot write the elements of `g[1..]`
  either, nor of `if c { s } else { return; }`, which it can of a variable
  holding that slice, `s` itself included. A view keys its
  slice's writability apart already (§3.4): a writable reference beside a
  read-only view, with a store through the reference allowed to put a
  read-only slice where the view is read-only, would lift the first where
  the parameter has one, and a view as writable as the slice, whatever the
  reference, the second.
* The growth-during-construction rule (§3.10) takes a parameter class to be
  possibly any global or captured local a callee grows, two classes of one
  activation to be one array unless every call site keeps both concrete and
  exact, and a callee still being checked to grow whatever its text names.
* While print, str or format runs a `format` overload, the views an argument
  reads through (an optional reference, a slice, a non-fixed array's
  elements, a holder's references) stay held even where the overload takes
  the whole argument and nothing of it is rendered around the call (§3.10,
  **Format overloads**).
* The C backend rejects: binding, copying or dispatching a *resizable* ADT
  payload; a reference to a resizable nested in a variable-size prefix or an
  ADT payload; copying a resizable value with a variable-size prefix; `==` on
  resizable structs; `self` in a frame object literal; a `format` overload by
  reference on a resizable without its own header; `str`/`to_bytes`/
  `from_bytes` into a fixed-size destination.
* `from_bytes` rejects element types with relative references into fields of
  elements, and fixed or limited destination arrays
  (`docs/design/serialization.md` §7).
* The JIT backend refuses programs that use workers or queues
  (`docs/design/jit_backend.md`).

## 11. Audit findings and resolutions

The failures below describe the pre-fix compiler (`316063d`), ordered by
impact. Runtime cases were reproduced at `-O0` and `-O2` through TinyCC and
native MSVC; the construction-copy gap was checked in generated C at both
levels. Each resolution records the corrected contract. An independent
implementation should satisfy those contracts, not reproduce the original
failures.

1. **Length-field overflow corrupts the containing layout.** `EmitLenStore`
   and the prefix-patching paths narrow counts without establishing that
   they fit. For `struct Packet { bytes: u8[u8], tail: i64 }`, constructing
   `Packet { bytes: [1; 256], tail: 42 }` succeeds: `bytes.len` is 0 and
   `tail` reads as 72340172838076673 (eight of the element bytes). A later
   reference field would likewise be read from the wrong location. All
   construction/adaptation paths need to preserve the length invariant,
   including statically known counts (spec §3.3).
   **Resolved:** known overflow is rejected; dynamic length stores and
   prefix adaptations check representability before narrowing.

2. **Field-default execution is missing from effects at its use sites.**
   `CheckFieldDefaults` checks a shared expression separately, while
   `CheckInits` visits only explicit initializers. With a global
   `data: i64[>..<] = [42]` and `struct S<T> { x: i64 = zap() }`, where
   `zap` clears `data` and returns 0, constructing `S<u8> {}` inside
   `if data.len > 0` leaves BCE's old length fact alive. A following
   `data[0]` prints 42; `--no-bce` correctly aborts at length 0. A retained
   element reference is also permitted across the hidden shrink. Defaults
   must contribute effects wherever they execute, not just when their
   type is first instantiated.
   **Resolved:** defaults are checked and expanded into each use site's
   tree, with isolated declaration bindings but the caller's live storage
   and effect context. This includes `default<T>()` and slice-pool fills.

3. **Stores through slice parameters vanish from the caller's lifetime
   record.** `ApplyCalleeStores` skips every slice-parameter destination.
   For `struct Holder { p: i64? }` and
   `fn save(xs: Holder[:], p: i64&) { xs[0].p .= p; }`, a caller can
   `save(holders, data[0])`, clear `data`, and subsequently dereference
   `holders[0].p`. Replacing the cleared element with 99 makes that stale
   reference print 99. A permutation-only optimization cannot justify
   dropping arbitrary incoming stores (section 3.5).
   **Resolved:** slice destinations participate in store replay, including
   recursive calls; only same-container read-backs preserve the old record.

4. **Rendering hooks are given fabricated writable provenance.**
   `UserFormatIn` specializes a by-reference `format` hook using writable
   placeholder arguments, rather than the actual rendered value's
   permissions. A `format(out: u8[>..]&, v: S&)` that assigns `v.x = 99`
   can be invoked by `print(s)` on `const s = S { x: 1 }`; both the hook
   and a subsequent `print(s.x)` print 99. Implicit hook calls must obey
   the same writability and effect rules as explicit calls.
   **Resolved:** hook checking uses the actual argument's permissions and
   roots, retains separate hook sets per rendered argument, and applies
   shrink/growth effects. BCE invalidates facts between hook executions.

5. **The byte verifier admits noncanonical values.** `NeedsVerifyWalk`
   treats booleans as opaque bytes, and `gs_uleb_check` accepts redundant
   high zero groups. `from_bytes<bool[>..]>([1, 2])` succeeds and produces
   a value that renders as `true` but compares unequal to `true`. For
   `struct V { x: varint }`, loading `[2, 128, 0]` succeeds with `x == 0`
   but compares unequal to a normally constructed `[V { x: 0 }]`, because
   `EmitEqBytes` assumes shortest varints. Loaded values must satisfy the
   same representation invariants as constructed ones (section 6.9).
   **Resolved:** verification checks boolean bytes and rejects redundant
   high zero groups in every checked varint, including the image prefix.

6. **An optional self-relative link can silently become null.** With
   `struct Node { next: Node&<u8>?, value: i64 }`, the legal-looking
   `nodes[0].next .= nodes[0]` stores offset zero because the field and
   element start coincide. Reading it gives null. `RelOffset`/`EmitRelStoreAt`
   check the numeric width but not this collision. The null encoding and
   acceptance rules need a consistent resolution; silently losing a
   non-null target is not intended reference semantics (spec §3.9).
   **Resolved:** optional self-relative stores reject a non-null target
   whose offset is zero. The packed encoding is unchanged; non-optional
   zero offsets and pool-relative links retain their existing meaning.

7. **Fill evaluation depends on the destination representation.** For
   `struct Node { value: i64, next: Node&<u8> }`, a fill
   `[Node { value: tick(), next: self }; 3]` calls `tick` three times when
   constructing `Node[3]`, but only once for `Node[>..]`. With an incrementing
   counter, the first array contains 1, 2, 3 and the second 4, 4, 4.
   `FixedArrayLitAt` and `GenArrayLit` disagree about repeated construction
   versus copying a fill. The language needs one evaluation rule for this
   form that preserves relative references; this discrepancy should not
   become a representation-dependent side-effect rule.
   **Resolved:** every fill evaluates its operand once, even for zero
   elements. Literal operands containing relative references capture their
   field values once and encode links at each destination; `self` denotes
   each new element. Variable-size operands also evaluate once.

8. **Float text is not always shortest.** `gs_fmt_f64` prints
   `1.000000000000001` as `1.0000000000000011`, even though the shorter
   spelling reads back to the same value. Its 15/17-digit strategy meets
   round-trip accuracy, but not spec §3.7's shortest-form promise.
   **Open:** the shortest-float formatting fix is deferred; the compiler
   retains its existing 15/17-digit formatting.

9. **Some construction paths still copy whole fresh results.** The
   fallbacks in section 6.5 contradict spec §4.3/§7.3's unconditional
   guarantee. For example, `out.append(make())`, with `make` returning a
   runtime-capacity `i64[..]`, constructs a separate limited-array image
   then copies its live elements into `out`. The generated C contains
   this copy at both optimization levels. This is a performance-contract
   gap, even when the program's values are correct; it is not a license
   for a replacement implementation to ignore the guarantee.
   **Resolved:** fresh runtime-capacity limited results and control
   expressions now construct on the receiving resizable's stack. Required
   packed-layout changes relocate bytes there; they do not materialize a
   separate result. Spec §4.3 allows that relocation, and separately allows
   staging a result of unknown length to check a limited receiver's capacity.
