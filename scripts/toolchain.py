"""Toolchain discovery and process measurement, shared by the runner scripts.

test/run_tests.py, samples/run_samples.py, bench/run_bench.py and
bench/bce_ab.py all need the same four things: the goose binary wherever CMake
put it, a C and a C++ compiler, a way to run what was built and read back what
it printed, and -- for the benchmarks -- the peak memory of that run. MSVC and
the gcc-style drivers disagree about the spelling of nearly every flag and the
two operating system families disagree about how to ask for a process's peak
memory, so both are wrapped here and the runners are written in terms of
intent.
