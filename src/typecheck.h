// Goose compiler — the typechecker. Whole-program, call-graph order (§10.1):
// starting from global initializers and main, every function is checked per
// unique specialization of (argument types, reference roots and writability,
// bound function values), with generic parameters substituted (§7.7, §10.2).
// Each specialization gets a clone of the function body with all annotations
// (types, resolved symbols) filled in; those clones are what later phases
// (optimization/codegen) consume.
//
// References are transparent (§3.8): an expression denoting a reference
// behaves as its pointee in every value context (the checker "decays" it),
// except where the destination type is itself a reference — initialization,
// reference-typed parameters/fields, `.=` — which binds the reference value.
// Plain `=` through a reference writes the pointee; `.=` rebinds it.
//
// The lifetime system (§9) is implemented as: every reference/slice-typed
// value carries every place it may point (Roots, ast.h): one alternative
// per root, a VarDef (null = static data) with a bit saying whether that
// root owns the pointee or merely outlives it, and the provenance bits
// (writable §9.5, reusable §5.4). A value that may be any of several -- an
// if's branches, a variable's bindings, a call's returns -- has all of
// their alternatives, and every rule asks each of them. Roots are compared
// by scope depth along the current compile-time call path; only rules that
// need the pointee's *identity* -- storing it as a relative reference
// (§3.9), and codegen's proof that two fat reference parameters are
// distinct stacks -- need a single exact alternative, and fall back to the
// conservative path without one. A reference read out of a container is
// re-rooted by ReadBackRoot: the container bounds the lifetime, and the
// candidate variables of the enclosing scope that can hold the pointee by
// value are its alternatives, exact where one is a variable's own storage
// (§9.5). Other deliberate v1 rules (now part of the spec, §9.2/§9.5): a
// read-back reference is writable regardless of its original provenance
// (writability launders through storage -- the language's const-cast
// loophole); a reference variable commits to one root depth for its whole
// life. A function's result is rooted as a branch value is: each call maps
// the roots its returns give to its own arguments.
// Inside a recursive cycle (§7.8) a reference may be stored
// only if it is rooted at a global, at a local of an enclosing function
// outside the cycle, at a pool parameter -- a parameter root class whose
// members are all references to resizable-class values, which no cycle
// function holds across a call into its cycle (VarDef::poolclass,
// JoinCycle), and which a back edge must then pass exactly as the entry call
// did (ValidatePoolArgs) -- or at a threaded parameter: a class of exactly
// rooted references or slices that every call into the cycle passes on as
// it was first given, from storage outside every cycle (ThreadedClass). A
// back edge may pass a threaded class something else, so a store relies on
// it, and that call is then an error at the store (ValidateThreadArgs). A
// cycle's *return* roots, shrinks, growths, stores and rebinds cannot come
// from its bodies' records while a back edge reaches a function before its
// body is checked through, so a cycle is checked in rounds: the first with
// back edges that have no effects and results pointing nowhere yet, each
// later one reading what the round before recorded, until nothing recorded
// changes (CheckSpecBody). Remaining conservatisms marked TODO: long-distance
// returns carry only global/static refs, and references rooted at a caller's
// fixed-size local that a call back into the cycle replaces are still
// pass-down-only inside a cycle.
//
// This file holds the TypeCheck class -- its state, the small utilities, and
// the driver -- with its members declared in the order they are defined
// across typecheck_types.h, typecheck_exprs.h, typecheck_flow.h,
// typecheck_calls.h and typecheck_builtins.h; the per-node Check overrides
