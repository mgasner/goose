"""Goose test runner: parses every test file, checks dump/reparse/dump
roundtrips to identical output, typechecks files not marked `parse-only` on
their first line, checks that error tests fail in the right phase, and (when a
C compiler is available) compiles and runs the generated C at -O0 and -O2,
comparing the two runs and required output in expected/<name>.out.
expected/<name>.aborts marks tests whose run is expected to end in a runtime
abort (nonzero exit) after printing their expected stdout. Each nonblank line
in expected/<name>.stderr must occur in stderr, so an unrelated crash cannot
satisfy an expected abort. Compiler error fixtures require `// error:`
diagnostic substrings in their source and the compiler's normal error exit.
`// warning:` substrings declare the warnings a fixture's typecheck prints,
one warning line each, in any order; a positive fixture without them must
print none. A first-line `runtime-debug` marker adds a targeted
GS_DEBUG=1 run, alongside the existing codegen_exec debug coverage.
A first-line `dump-runtime` marker also executes the parser's dump, checking
that stable roundtripping preserved the original program's behavior.

A compiler built with the TinyCC backend runs the same programs a second way,
in JIT mode: no C file and no external compiler, the generated C built and run
inside the compiler process. Those runs are compared with the same blessed
outputs. A first-line `no-jit` marker leaves a test out of them, and a program
the backend refuses outright is counted as a skip, not a failure.

The audio/ tests use the SDL3 PCM mixer without a device, the gfx/ tests
use the SDL3 graphics module, the physics/ tests the Box3D
physics module, the sqlite/ tests the SQLite module and the ui/ tests the
Nuklear ui module. They always parse,
typecheck and generate C; they build and run where the compiler has the
native layers they use built in -- their category's, and any other they
import, as a ui test drawing through gfx does -- linking what `goose
--audio-link`, `--gfx-link`, `--physics-link`, `--sqlite-link` or `--ui-link` names, and a machine without a
GPU device counts as a skip for gfx. A fixture there with `// error:`
markers is a rejection test, as in errors_tc/. test/api_check.py checks
stdlib/audio.goose, stdlib/gfx.goose, stdlib/physics.goose, stdlib/sqlite.goose and
stdlib/ui.goose against their C
layers' own lists of functions, structs and constants.

Profiles keep the CI coverage deliberate: baseline compares Goose/native C
-O0 and -O2 plus the targeted debug-runtime runs; sanitize uses Goose -O2 and
Clang -O1 with ASan/UBSan on Linux, including the samples and C runtime tests.
The goose_in_goose/ compiler is one multi-file bootstrap fixture: build three
native generations, require identical stage-2/stage-3 C, and run a self-check
of the stage-2 compiler, which stands for both, beside stage 3's build.
TinyCC also emits the same C when available.

The work runs on --jobs threads, each waiting on the processes it starts, and
the log comes out in the same order whatever the number of jobs: each piece of
work prints into a buffer of its own, shown once everything before it has
been. A fixture's own runs happen one after another, since a program may write
files the next run of it would see. The bootstrap's chains at each level, its
JIT self-compiles and the samples' runner start first, being the longest.
One compiler run per fixture parses, checks the dump roundtrip (--roundtrip)
and typechecks; one per level writes the C and also runs the program through
TinyCC (-o with --jit). -j1 runs everything in order on one thread.

The checking runs go --batch files to one compiler process (goose
--multi-test), and the C of --batch fixtures builds into one executable that
runs any of their programs (CC.compile_programs), each run still a process of
its own; a batch that crashes or does not build leaves its files to runs of
their own, which report the failure as theirs. --batch 1 runs everything one
to a process.
